The code includes two classes, OpenAPIEndpointChain and APIRequesterChain, as well as a PromptTemplate class for generating instructions. The OpenAPIEndpointChain class interacts with an OpenAPI endpoint using natural language, and has methods for constructing the path, extracting query and body parameters, and deserializing input from a serialized TypeScript dictionary. The APIRequesterChain class is used to parse requests and errors from the OpenAPI endpoint, and includes a method for getting the request parser from the PromptTemplate, and a method for parsing the requests and errors using the APIRequesterOutputParser. The code also includes functions for validating the input and output variables of the PromptTemplate classes. Keywords for this code could be OpenAPI, APIRequesterChain, APIResponderChain, PromptTemplate, and TypeScript.
