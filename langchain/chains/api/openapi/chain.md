The code defines a Chain class called APIChain that makes API calls and summarizes the responses to answer a question. It includes two LLMChain classes for generating API URLs and summarizing API responses based on given API documentation and user questions. It also includes a TextRequestsWrapper class for handling HTTP requests and responses. The code provides functions for validating the input and output variables of the PromptTemplate classes, as well as for calling and asynchronously calling the APIChain. The code does not define any other specific classes or functions.

The code defines a class called OpenAPIEndpointChain that interacts with an OpenAPI endpoint using natural language. It includes an APIRequesterChain and an APIResponderChain for making API calls and summarizing the responses based on given API documentation and user questions. The code also defines a PromptTemplate class for generating the instructions for the OpenAPIEndpointChain, as well as functions for validating the input and output variables of the PromptTemplate classes. The OpenAPIEndpointChain class includes methods for constructing the path from the deserialized input, extracting the query and body parameters from the input, and deserializing the input from a serialized TypeScript dictionary. It also includes a method for getting the output from the API call.
