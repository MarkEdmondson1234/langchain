The code defines several functions and dictionaries for parsing the structure of a webpage, including finding attributes of nodes, adding nodes to a hash tree, and converting node names to more general categories like "link" or "button". There are no classes defined in this code. Keywords for this code could include "webpage parsing", "DOMSnapshot", and "hash tree". The code processes elements in the viewport of a webpage, filtering out elements that do not hold text or have click handlers, and merging text from leaf#text nodes with their parent nodes. It then creates a list of elements of interest, which includes the node index, backend node ID, node name, node value, node meta data, and other information. Finally, the code returns the list of elements of interest. As for the OPEN_METEO_DOCS, it contains API documentation for the Open Meteo website, including information on the API endpoint /v1/forecast, which accepts a geographical coordinate, a list of weather variables, and responds with a JSON hourly weather forecast for 7 days. It also lists the URL parameters and their descriptions, as well as the hourly parameter definition and its variables.
