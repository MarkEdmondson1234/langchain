The code you provided includes several classes and functions related to language models and prompts. The classes include BasePromptSelector, which is an abstract base class that defines a method for getting the default prompt for a language model, and ConditionalPromptSelector, which is a subclass of BasePromptSelector that allows for multiple prompts to be defined based on conditions. The functions include is_llm, which returns True if the input is an instance of BaseLLM, and is_chat_model, which returns True if the input is an instance of BaseChatModel. The purpose of this code is to provide a framework for working with language models and prompts in a flexible and customizable way.
