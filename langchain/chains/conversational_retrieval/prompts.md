The code defines two PromptTemplate classes, CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT and QA_PROMPT, for generating prompts for conversational queries. The CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT class takes in a chat history and a follow-up question and generates a prompt for rephrasing the follow-up question as a standalone question. The QA_PROMPT class takes in context and a question and generates a prompt for answering the question based on the given context. There are no other classes, functions, or methods defined in the code. Keywords suitable for this code might include PromptTemplate, conversational queries, and rephrasing.
