This code defines a class called ConstitutionalChain that applies constitutional principles to the outputs of another chain. It imports several modules and classes, including BaseLanguageModel, CallbackManagerForChainRun, Chain, ConstitutionalPrinciple, PRINCIPLES, CRITIQUE_PROMPT, REVISION_PROMPT, LLMChain, and BasePromptTemplate. The class includes methods for getting principles, creating a chain from an LLM, and parsing critiques. The code example provided shows how to use the class to run a question through a few-shot learning model and apply a constitutional principle to the output. Keywords for this code could include "chain application", "constitutional principles", and "module import".
