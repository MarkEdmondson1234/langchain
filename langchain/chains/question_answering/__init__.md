This code loads question answering chains and defines several classes and chains for combining documents and generating prompts for language model training and document analysis. The code is organized into three main sections: Prompt Generation for Language Model Training, Hypothetical Document Embeddings, and Prompt Selector and Templates for Document Analysis. Each section includes a title, summary, keywords, classes, functions/methods, and code examples of use. The specific code you provided loads question answering chains and imports several modules and classes for combining documents and generating prompts. Unfortunately, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more detailed summary.

This code defines several functions for loading and combining documents using language models. Specifically, it defines a LoadingCallable protocol for loading the combine documents chain, as well as two functions for loading the map-rerank and stuff chains. The code also includes several optional arguments for each function, such as the prompt, document variable name, and callback manager. Unfortunately, without more context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed summary.

This code defines two functions for loading and combining documents using language models. The first function, _load_map_reduce_chain, loads the map-reduce chain and includes several optional arguments for the prompt, document variable name, and callback manager. The second function, _load_refine_chain, loads the refine chain and includes several optional arguments for the prompt, document variable name, and callback manager. Both functions return a chain object that can be used for document analysis.

This code defines a function called load_qa_chain that loads a question answering chain based on the specified chain type and language model. The function takes in several optional arguments, such as verbose mode and callback manager, and returns a chain object to use for question answering. The code also includes a loader mapping dictionary that maps each chain type to its corresponding loading function. The supported chain types are "stuff", "map_reduce", "map_rerank", and "refine".
