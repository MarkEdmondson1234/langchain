This code defines a prompt template for generating prompts for question answering. The code includes an output parser, RegexParser, which extracts the answer and score from the output of the question answering model. The prompt template includes instructions for answering the question and returning a score between 0 and 100 based on the quality of the answer. The prompt also includes several examples and guidelines for determining the score. The PROMPT object is a PromptTemplate that takes in the context and question as input variables and uses the output parser to extract the answer and score from the model output.
