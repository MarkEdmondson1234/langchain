The code defines four PromptTemplate classes for generating instructions for different tasks. The classes are called CREATE_DRAFT_ANSWER_PROMPT, LIST_ASSERTIONS_PROMPT, CHECK_ASSERTIONS_PROMPT, and REVISED_ANSWER_PROMPT. Each class includes a template string with placeholders for input variables, and the PromptTemplate class provides a method for filling in those placeholders with user input. The input variables for each class are "question", "statement", and "assertions". The code also imports the PromptTemplate class from the langchain.prompts.prompt module. Keywords for this code could be PromptTemplate, user input, and text processing.
