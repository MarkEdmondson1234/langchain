The code defines a chain for question-answering with self-verification. It includes several classes, such as BaseLanguageModel, CallbackManagerForChainRun, Chain, LLMChain, SequentialChain, and PromptTemplate. The _load_question_to_checked_assertions_chain function loads a question to a chain of LLM models that generate a revised statement based on the user's input. The code also includes several PromptTemplate classes for generating instructions for different tasks, such as creating a draft answer, listing assumptions, checking assertions, and revising an answer. Keywords for this code could be question-answering, self-verification, LLM models, and PromptTemplate.

The code defines an LLMCheckerChain class for question-answering with self-verification. The class includes several PromptTemplate classes for generating instructions for different tasks, such as creating a draft answer, listing assumptions, checking assertions, and revising an answer. The code also includes several other classes, such as BaseLanguageModel, CallbackManagerForChainRun, Chain, LLMChain, and SequentialChain.
