This code defines a Python script that implements Program-Aided Language Models. It includes a PALChain class that uses an LLMChain to generate code to solve problems based on prompts. The code includes methods for generating math prompts and colored object prompts. The PALChain class includes several properties and methods for managing inputs and outputs, including the input_keys and output_keys properties, which return the singular input and output keys, respectively. The _call method is used to run the chain and generate an output based on the inputs. The code also includes several class method constructors for creating PALChain objects from math prompts or colored object prompts.
