This code defines several PromptTemplate objects for generating prompts for SQL query answering. The PROMPT object generates a prompt for creating a syntactically correct SQL query and returning the answer based on the query results. The DECIDER_PROMPT object generates a prompt for selecting relevant table names based on the input question and list of potential tables. The DUCKDB_PROMPT and GOOGLESQL_PROMPT objects generate prompts for creating DuckDB and GoogleSQL queries, respectively, and returning the answer based on the query results. All PromptTemplate objects take in input variables and use a template to generate the prompt. The code also includes specific templates for generating prompts for specific SQL databases, including MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. The Chain class is defined for interacting with SQL databases, and it includes several methods for running queries and returning results. The LLMChain class is a subclass of Chain that uses a language model to generate SQL queries. The SQLDatabase class provides an interface for interacting with SQL databases, including methods for connecting to a database, running queries, and retrieving results. The code also includes several utility functions and classes for managing callbacks and validating input data.

The provided human input seems to be a copy-paste of a specific method in the code, rather than a summary of the entire code.

This code defines a chain for querying SQL databases that is a sequential chain. The chain first determines which tables to use based on the query, and then calls the normal SQL database chain based on those tables. This is useful in cases where the number of tables in the database is large. The code includes several classes for interacting with SQL databases, including the SQLDatabaseChain class and the SQLDatabase class, as well as several utility functions and classes for managing callbacks and validating input data.
