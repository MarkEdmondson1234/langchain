This code defines several PromptTemplate objects for generating prompts for SQL query answering. The PROMPT object generates a prompt for creating a syntactically correct SQL query and returning the answer based on the query results. The DECIDER_PROMPT object generates a prompt for selecting relevant table names based on the input question and list of potential tables. The DUCKDB_PROMPT and GOOGLESQL_PROMPT objects generate prompts for creating DuckDB and GoogleSQL queries, respectively, and returning the answer based on the query results. All PromptTemplate objects take in input variables and use a template to generate the prompt.
