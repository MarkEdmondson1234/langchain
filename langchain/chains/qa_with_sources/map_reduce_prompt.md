The code includes functions for loading and combining documents for question answering with sources. The functions include _load_refine_chain, which loads a RefineDocumentsChain for refining answers, and load_qa_with_sources_chain, which loads a chain for question answering with sources. The code also includes several classes for combining documents, including BaseCombineDocumentsChain, MapReduceDocumentsChain, MapRerankDocumentsChain, RefineDocumentsChain, and StuffDocumentsChain. The keywords for this code could be "question answering," "sources," "combine documents," and "language model."

## code examples of use
Here is an example of how to use the code to answer a question:

```
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

question_prompt_template = """Use the following portion of a long document to see if any of the text is relevant to answer the question. 
Return any relevant text verbatim.
{context}
Question: {question}
Relevant text, if any:"""

QUESTION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=question_prompt_template, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)

combine_prompt_template = """Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer with references ("SOURCES"). 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.
ALWAYS return a "SOURCES" part in your answer.
