The code defines a script that loads question answering with sources chains. It includes several classes for combining documents, including BaseCombineDocumentsChain, MapReduceDocumentsChain, MapRerankDocumentsChain, RefineDocumentsChain, and StuffDocumentsChain. It also includes an LLMChain class and several prompts for question answering with sources, including map_reduce_prompt, refine_prompts, stuff_prompt, and map_rerank_prompt. The code also imports the BasePromptTemplate class from langchain.prompts.base.

The code includes several functions for loading and combining documents for question answering with sources. The functions include LoadingCallable, which is an interface for loading the combine documents chain, _load_map_rerank_chain, which loads a MapRerankDocumentsChain for question answering with sources, _load_stuff_chain, which loads a StuffDocumentsChain for question answering with sources, and _load_map_reduce_chain, which loads a MapReduceDocumentsChain for question answering with sources. The code also includes several classes for combining documents, including BaseCombineDocumentsChain, MapReduceDocumentsChain, MapRerankDocumentsChain, RefineDocumentsChain, and StuffDocumentsChain. Additionally, the code imports the BasePromptTemplate class from langchain.prompts.base. The keywords for this code could be "question answering," "sources," "combine documents," and "language model."
