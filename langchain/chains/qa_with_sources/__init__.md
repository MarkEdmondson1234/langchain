This code is a Python script that loads a question answering system with sources chains. It imports the "load_qa_with_sources_chain" function from the "qa_with_sources.loading" module in the "langchain.chains" package. The "__all__" variable is used to specify the functions or variables that should be exported when the module is imported. 

As for the keywords, "question answering", "sources chains", and "loading" could be suitable. There is only one function imported in this script, so there are no classes or methods to describe. 

An example of how to use this code would be to import the "load_qa_with_sources_chain" function and call it with the necessary inputs to load a question answering system with sources chains.
