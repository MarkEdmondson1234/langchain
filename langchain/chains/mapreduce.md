This code defines a Map-reduce chain that splits up a document, sends the smaller parts to the LLM with one prompt, and then combines the results with another one. The code defines the MapReduceChain class, which has several properties and a method called _call. The class has three properties: combine_documents_chain, text_splitter, input_key, and output_key. The _call method takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The class also has a class method called from_params that constructs a map-reduce chain that uses the chain for map and reduce. Keywords for this code might include "map-reduce", "LLM", "document splitting", and "text processing".
