This code defines a class called LLMRequestsChain, which is a chain that hits a URL and then uses an LLM (language model) to parse the results. The class has several properties, including llm_chain, which is an instance of the LLMChain class, and requests_wrapper, which is an instance of the TextRequestsWrapper class. The class also has several private properties, including requests_key, input_key, and output_key. The class has a method called _call, which takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The method uses the requests_wrapper to get the contents of the URL, extracts the text from the HTML using BeautifulSoup, and then uses the llm_chain to predict the output based on the text. The code also includes several imports and a root_validator method that validates that the bs4 python package is installed. Keywords for this code might include "language models", "requests", and "web scraping".
