This code defines a base interface that all chains should implement. The code imports several libraries, including yaml, json, and pydantic. The code also imports several classes and functions from the langchain library, including BaseCallbackManager, AsyncCallbackManager, AsyncCallbackManagerForChainRun, CallbackManager, CallbackManagerForChainRun, Callbacks, and BaseMemory. The code defines a function called _get_verbosity that returns the verbosity level of the langchain library. Keywords for this code might include "interface", "pydantic", and "callback manager".

This code defines methods and classes for running the logic of a chain and adding to the output if desired. The code includes the Chain class, which is a base interface that all chains should implement. The code also includes the acall method, which runs the logic of the chain and adds to the output if desired. Other methods include prep_inputs, prep_outputs, and _validate_inputs. Keywords for this code might include "chain logic", "input validation", and "output preparation".

This code defines methods and classes for running the logic of a chain and adding to the output if desired. The code includes the Chain class, which is a base interface that all chains should implement. The code also includes the apply method, which calls the chain on all inputs in the list, and the run and arun methods, which run the chain as text in, text out or multiple variables, text out. Other methods include dict and save for returning a dictionary representation of the chain and saving the chain, respectively. Keywords for this code might include "chain logic", "input validation", and "output preparation".
