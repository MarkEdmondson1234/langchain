The code you provided defines a chain pipeline where the outputs of one step feed directly into the next. It includes the Chain class, which is the base class for all chains, and several callback managers. The code also imports the get_color_mapping function and uses the pydantic library. Keywords for this code might include "chain pipeline", "callbacks", and "pydantic".

The code you provided defines a SequentialChain class, which is a chain pipeline where the outputs of one step feed directly into the next. The class has several properties, including chains, input_variables, output_variables, and return_all. The class also has a method called _call that takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The class uses several callback managers and the pydantic library. Keywords for this code might include "chain pipeline", "callbacks", and "pydantic".

This code defines an async function called _acall that takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The function is used in a class called SequentialChain, which is a chain pipeline where the outputs of one step feed directly into the next. The class has several properties, including chains, input_variables, output_variables, and return_all. The class uses several callback managers and the pydantic library. Keywords for this code might include "chain pipeline", "callbacks", "async function", and "pydantic".

The code you provided defines a class called SimpleSequentialChain, which is a simple chain where the outputs of one step feed directly into the next. The class has several properties, including chains, strip_outputs, input_key, and output_key. The class also has two methods called _call and _acall that take in a dictionary of inputs and return a dictionary of outputs. The class uses several callback managers and the pydantic library. Keywords for this code might include "chain pipeline", "callbacks", and "pydantic".
