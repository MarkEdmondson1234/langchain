This code defines a class called Chain that formats a prompt and calls an LLM (language model). The class has several properties, including AsyncCallbackManager, AsyncCallbackManagerForChainRun, CallbackManager, CallbackManagerForChainRun, Callbacks, BasePromptTemplate, PromptTemplate, LLMResult, and PromptValue. The class has a method called _call, which takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The method uses the get_colored_text function to format the prompt and then calls the language model to predict the output based on the prompt. Keywords for this code might include "language models", "prompts", and "callbacks".

This code defines a class called LLMChain that is used to run queries against language models. The class has several properties, including prompt, llm, and output_key. The class has several methods, including _call, generate, and prep_prompts. The _call method takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs. The generate method generates language model results from inputs, and the prep_prompts method prepares prompts from inputs. The purpose of this code is to provide a reusable component that can be used to quickly run queries against language models. Keywords for this code might include "language models", "prompts", and "querying".

This code defines two classes, Chain and LLMChain, that are used to quickly build complex language models and run queries against language models, respectively. The Chain class has several properties and a method called _call, while the LLMChain class has several properties and methods, including generate, prep_prompts, create_outputs, and predict. The purpose of this code is to provide a library of pre-built components that can be used to quickly build and run language models. Keywords for this code might include "language models", "chains", "prompts", and "querying".

In terms of classes, the code defines the LLMChain class, which is used to run queries against language models, and the Chain class, which is used to build complex language models. 

The LLMChain class has several methods, including generate, prep_prompts, create_outputs, predict, predict_and_parse, apply_and_parse, _parse_result, aapply_and_parse, and from_string. The generate method generates language model results from inputs, the prep_prompts method prepares prompts from inputs, and the create_outputs method creates outputs from responses. The predict method formats prompts with kwargs and passes them to LLM, while predict_and_parse calls predict and then parses the results. The apply_and_parse method calls apply and then parses the results, while _parse_result parses the results of apply. The aapply_and_parse method is similar to apply_and_parse, but is asynchronous. The from_string method creates an LLMChain from an LLM and a template.

The Chain class has several properties, including prompt, llm, and output_key, and a method called _call. The _call method takes in a dictionary of inputs and returns a dictionary of outputs.
