The code defines classes that combine documents in different ways, including a class called RefineDocumentsChain that does a first pass and then refines on more documents. Other classes include LLMChain, Document, Callbacks, BasePromptTemplate, and PromptTemplate. Keywords for this code could be document, combine, and refine. The classes have methods such as combine_docs and acombine_docs, which take in inputs and return outputs. The code also includes functions like _construct_result and _construct_refine_inputs, which are used by the classes. An example of how to use the RefineDocumentsChain class is not provided in the code.

The code defines a class called MapReduceDocumentsChain that combines documents by mapping a chain over them and then combining the results. It includes several other classes, such as LLMChain, Document, Callbacks, BaseCombineDocumentsChain, and BasePromptTemplate. The code imports the Callbacks class from the langchain.callbacks.manager module and the BaseCombineDocumentsChain class from the langchain.chains.combine_documents.base module. Keywords for this code could be document, combine, and map reduce. The MapReduceDocumentsChain class has several methods including combine_docs and acombine_docs, which take in inputs and return outputs. The class also has input and output keys, which are used to specify the inputs and outputs of the class.
