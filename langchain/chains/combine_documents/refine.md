The code defines a class called BaseCombineDocumentsChain that combines documents by doing a first pass and then refining on more documents. It also includes several other classes, such as LLMChain, Document, Callbacks, BasePromptTemplate, and PromptTemplate. The code imports the format_document function from the langchain.chains.combine_documents.base module. Keywords for this code could be document, combine, and refine. The _get_default_document_prompt function returns a default PromptTemplate object.

The code defines a class called RefineDocumentsChain that combines documents by doing a first pass and then refining on more documents. It also includes several other classes, such as LLMChain, Document, Callbacks, BasePromptTemplate, and PromptTemplate. The code imports the format_document function from the langchain.chains.combine_documents.base module. Keywords for this code could be document, combine, and refine. The RefineDocumentsChain class has several methods including combine_docs, which takes in inputs and returns outputs. The class also has input and output keys, which are used to specify the inputs and outputs of the class. An example of how to use the RefineDocumentsChain class is not provided in the code.
