The class also has input and output keys, which are used to specify the inputs and outputs of the class. The code also includes several root validators and a configuration for the pydantic object.

The code defines a class called AnalyzeDocumentChain that splits documents and analyzes them in pieces using a text splitter and a combine documents chain. The class has an input key for the document to be analyzed and an output key for the combined documents. The class also has a property for the input keys and output keys, and a method called _call that takes in inputs and returns outputs. The code includes several other classes, such as BaseCombineDocumentsChain, TextSplitter, and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter. The code does not include any keywords suitable for this code.
