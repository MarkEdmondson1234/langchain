There are no classes defined in this code. Keywords for this code could include "webpage parsing", "DOMSnapshot", and "hash tree". The code processes elements in the viewport of a webpage, filtering out elements that do not hold text or have click handlers, and merging text from leaf#text nodes with their parent nodes. It then creates a list of elements of interest, which includes the node index, backend node ID, node name, node value, node meta data, and other information. Finally, the code returns the list of elements of interest.
