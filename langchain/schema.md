This code defines several classes and functions related to message passing and text generation. The `get_buffer_string` function takes a list of `BaseMessage` objects and returns a formatted string of their contents. The `AgentAction` and `AgentFinish` classes define the inputs and outputs of an agent's actions. The `Generation` class represents the output of a single text generation, with the `text` attribute containing the generated text and `generation_info` containing any additional information. The `BaseMessage` class is an abstract base class for message objects, with several subclasses including `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `SystemMessage`, and `ChatMessage`. The `messages_to_dict` and `messages_from_dict` functions convert lists of `BaseMessage` objects to and from dictionaries for serialization. The `ChatGeneration` class extends `Generation` with an additional `message` attribute representing the message that prompted the generation.

This code defines several classes related to chat generation and document interaction. The `ChatResult` and `LLMResult` classes contain information about generated text, with `ChatResult` specifically for chat generation and `LLMResult` for arbitrary language model generation. The `PromptValue` class defines the input prompt for a generation, with methods to convert it to a string or list of messages. The `BaseMemory` class is an abstract base class for memory in a chatbot, with methods for loading and saving memory variables and clearing memory contents. The `BaseChatMessageHistory` class is an abstract base class for storing chat message history, with methods for adding user and AI messages and clearing the history. Finally, the `Document` class provides an interface for interacting with a document, with attributes for the document's content and metadata.

This code defines several classes related to document interaction and language model output parsing. The `Document` class provides an interface for interacting with a document, with attributes for the document's content and metadata. The `BaseRetriever` class is an abstract base class for retrieving relevant documents based on a query. The `BaseOutputParser` class is an abstract base class for parsing the output of a language model call, with methods for parsing the output and formatting instructions. The `OutputParserException` class is an exception that output parsers can raise to signify a parsing error. Finally, the `BaseDocumentTransformer` class is an abstract base class for transforming documents, with methods for transforming a list of documents synchronously and asynchronously.
