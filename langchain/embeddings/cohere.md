This code defines a wrapper class `CohereEmbeddings` around Cohere embedding models. The class includes two functions: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` calls out to Cohere's embedding endpoint and computes document embeddings, taking in a list of texts to embed. `embed_query` also calls out to Cohere's embedding endpoint and computes query embeddings, taking in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs. The code includes a root validator that validates that the necessary environment variables and packages exist. To use this code, you should have the `cohere` python package installed and the environment variable `COHERE_API_KEY` set with your API key or pass it as a named parameter to the constructor.
