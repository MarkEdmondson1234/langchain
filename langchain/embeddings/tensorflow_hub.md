This code defines a wrapper class `TensorflowHubEmbeddings` around TensorflowHub embedding models. The class takes in a model URL and includes two functions: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` computes document embeddings using a TensorflowHub embedding model, and takes in a list of texts to embed. `embed_query` computes query embeddings using a TensorflowHub embedding model, and takes in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs. The code includes a root validator that validates that the necessary environment variables and packages exist.
