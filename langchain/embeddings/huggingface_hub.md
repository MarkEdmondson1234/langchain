This code defines a wrapper class `HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings` around HuggingFace Hub embedding models. The class includes two functions: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` calls out to HuggingFace Hub's embedding endpoint and computes document embeddings, taking in a list of texts to embed. `embed_query` also calls out to HuggingFace Hub's embedding endpoint and computes query embeddings, taking in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs. The code includes a root validator that validates that the necessary environment variables and packages exist. To use this code, you should have the `huggingface_hub` python package installed and the environment variable `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN` set with your API key or pass it as a named parameter to the constructor. The input and output types for each function are as follows:

`HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings.embed_documents(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`
- `texts`: a list of strings to embed
- returns: a list of lists of floats representing the embeddings for each text

`HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings.embed_query(text: str) -> List[float]`
- `text`: a string to embed
- returns: a list of floats representing the embeddings for the text
