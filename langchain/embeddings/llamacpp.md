# Heading
This code defines wrapper classes around various embedding models, including HuggingFace and Cohere models, and an interface class for embedding models.

## Functions
There are several classes defined in this code, including `SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings`, `CohereEmbeddings`, and `Embeddings`. 

`SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings` and `CohereEmbeddings` are wrapper classes around HuggingFace and Cohere embedding models, respectively. Both classes include two functions: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` computes document embeddings using the respective model and takes in a list of texts to embed. `embed_query` computes query embeddings using the respective model and takes in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs.

`Embeddings` is an interface class for embedding models and includes two abstract methods: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. 

# Inputs and outputs for each function
`embed_documents` takes in a list of texts to embed and returns a list of embeddings, one for each text. `embed_query` takes in a text to embed and returns embeddings for that text.

The input and output types for each function are as follows:

`SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings.embed_documents(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`
- `texts`: a list of strings to embed
- returns: a list of lists of floats representing the embeddings for each text

`SelfHostedHuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings.embed_query(text: str) -> List[float]`
- `text`: a string to embed
- returns: a list of floats representing the embeddings for the text

`CohereEmbeddings.embed_documents(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`
- `texts`: a list of strings to embed
- returns: a list of lists of floats representing the embeddings for each text

`CohereEmbeddings.embed_query(text: str) -> List[float]`
- `text`: a string to embed
- returns: a list of floats representing the embeddings for the text

`Embeddings.embed_documents(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`
- `texts`: a list of strings to embed
- returns: a list of lists of floats representing the embeddings for each text

`Embeddings.embed_query(text: str) -> List[float]`
- `text`: a string to embed
- returns: a list of floats representing the embeddings for the text

This code defines a wrapper class `CohereEmbeddings` around Cohere embedding models. The class includes two functions: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` calls out to Cohere's embedding endpoint and computes document embeddings, taking in a list of texts to embed. `embed_query` also calls out to Cohere's embedding endpoint and computes query embeddings, taking in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs. The code includes a root validator that validates that the necessary environment variables and packages exist. To use this code, you should have the `cohere` python package installed and the environment variable `COHERE_API_KEY` set with your API key or pass it as a named parameter to the constructor.

This code also defines an interface class `Embeddings` for embedding models. The class includes two abstract methods: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` embeds search documents and takes in a list of texts to embed, and `embed_query` embeds query text and takes in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs.

- `text`: a string to embed
- returns: a list of floats representing the embeddings for the text

Lastly, this code defines a wrapper class `LlamaCppEmbeddings` around llama.cpp embedding models. The class includes two functions: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` embeds a list of documents using the Llama model and takes in a list of texts to embed. `embed_query` embeds a query using the Llama model and takes in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs. The input and output types for each function are also described in the code.
