This code defines an interface class `Embeddings` for embedding models. The class includes two abstract methods: `embed_documents` and `embed_query`. `embed_documents` embeds search documents and takes in a list of texts to embed, and `embed_query` embeds query text and takes in a text to embed. Both functions return embeddings as outputs.
