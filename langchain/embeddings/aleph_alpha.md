# Heading
This code defines a wrapper around Jina embedding models. The `JinaEmbeddings` class is a subclass of the `BaseModel` and `Embeddings` classes and includes methods for embedding documents and queries using a custom embedding model running on Jina's remote hardware. The code also includes a root validator function for validating the Jina auth token and checking that the required Python package exists.

## Functions
- `JinaEmbeddings`: A class that wraps around Jina embedding models and includes methods for embedding documents and queries using a custom embedding model running on Jina's remote hardware.
- `validate_environment`: A root validator function that validates the Jina auth token and checks that the required Python package exists.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `JinaEmbeddings`
  - `embed_documents(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`: Takes a list of texts as input and returns a list of embeddings, one for each text.
  - `embed_query(text: str) -> List[float]`: Takes a text as input and returns embeddings for the text.
- `validate_environment`: Takes no inputs and returns a dictionary of validated values.

The code also imports and defines classes for different embedding models, including Jina, HuggingFace, OpenAI, and more. The specific functions and inputs/outputs for each tool are not described in this code snippet.

This code defines a wrapper class for Aleph Alpha's Asymmetric Embeddings. The `AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding` class includes methods for embedding documents and queries using Aleph Alpha's remote hardware. The code also includes a root validator function for validating the Aleph Alpha auth token and checking that the required Python package exists. 

## Functions

- `validate_environment`: A root validator function that validates the Aleph Alpha auth token and checks that the required Python package exists.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding`
  - `embed_documents(texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]`: Takes a list of texts as input and returns a list of embeddings, one for each text.
  - `embed_query(text: str) -> List[float]`: Takes a text as input and returns embeddings for the text.
- `validate_environment`: Takes no inputs and returns a dictionary of validated values.

This code defines a method for embedding a query using Aleph Alpha's asymmetric embedding models. The `embed_query` method takes a text as input and returns embeddings for the text. The code imports necessary packages and defines parameters for the embedding request. The method then sends the request to Aleph Alpha's remote hardware and returns the resulting embeddings.

This code defines a symmetric version of Aleph Alpha's semantic embeddings called `AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding`. This class includes methods for embedding documents and queries using Aleph Alpha's remote hardware. The code imports necessary packages and defines parameters for the embedding request. The `embed_documents` method takes a list of texts as input and returns a list of embeddings, one for each text. The `embed_query` method takes a text as input and returns embeddings for the text. Both methods call out to Aleph Alpha's remote hardware to perform the embedding.
