The code defines a wrapper class `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` around HuggingFace's transformer models, which includes methods for embedding text using HuggingFace's remote hardware. The class can be used with Microsoft Azure endpoints by setting the corresponding environment variables. The code also imports necessary packages and defines parameters for the embedding request. The `embed_documents` function computes document embeddings using a HuggingFace transformer model, while the `embed_query` function computes query embeddings using a HuggingFace transformer model. Both functions take in text inputs and return embeddings as outputs. The code includes a root validator that validates that the necessary environment variables and packages exist.

The code defines a wrapper class `HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings` around HuggingFace's transformer models, which includes methods for embedding text using HuggingFace's remote hardware. The class can be used with Microsoft Azure endpoints by setting the corresponding environment variables. The code also imports necessary packages and defines parameters for the embedding request. The `embed_documents` function computes document embeddings using a HuggingFace instruct model, while the `embed_query` function computes query embeddings using a HuggingFace instruct model. Both functions take in text inputs and return embeddings as outputs. The code includes a root validator that validates that the necessary environment variables and packages exist.
