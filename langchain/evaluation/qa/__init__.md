# Summary of script purpose
The code defines classes and utilities related to evaluating and generating question answering functionality using a language model. 

## Functions
- `QAEvalChain`: Inherits from `LLMChain` and is specifically designed for evaluating question answering models using a prompt template with input variables "query", "answer", and "result".
- `ContextQAEvalChain`: Inherits from `LLMChain` and is specifically designed for evaluating question answering models using a prompt template with input variables "query", "context", and "result".
- `CotQAEvalChain`: Inherits from `ContextQAEvalChain` and is specifically designed for evaluating question answering models using chain of thought reasoning.
- `QAGenerateChain`: Inherits from `LLMChain` and is specifically designed for generating examples for question answering using a prompt template called `PROMPT`.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `QAEvalChain`: Inputs are a base language model and a prompt template containing the input variables "query", "answer", and "result". Outputs are a list of dictionaries containing the evaluation results.
- `ContextQAEvalChain`: Inputs are a base language model and a prompt template containing the input variables "query", "context", and "result". Outputs are a list of dictionaries containing the evaluation results.
- `CotQAEvalChain`: Inputs are the same as `ContextQAEvalChain`. Outputs are the same as `ContextQAEvalChain`.
- `QAGenerateChain`: Inputs are a base language model. Outputs are generated examples for question answering.

The code also imports various modules and classes from the `langchain` package.
