The code defines two classes, `QAEvalChain` and `ContextQAEvalChain`, for evaluating question answering models using a language model. Both classes inherit from `LLMChain` and include a `from_llm` method for loading the evaluation chain from a base language model and a `evaluate` method for evaluating question answering examples and predictions. The `QAEvalChain` class uses a prompt template with input variables "query", "answer", and "result", while the `ContextQAEvalChain` class uses a prompt template with input variables "query", "context", and "result". The code imports various modules and classes from the `langchain` package.

The code defines a class called `CotQAEvalChain` that inherits from `ContextQAEvalChain` and is specifically designed for evaluating question answering models using chain of thought reasoning. The class includes a `from_llm` method for loading the evaluation chain from a base language model and a `validate_input_vars` method for validating the input variables in the prompt template. The `CotQAEvalChain` class uses a prompt template with input variables "query", "context", and "result". The code also imports various modules and classes from the `langchain` package.
