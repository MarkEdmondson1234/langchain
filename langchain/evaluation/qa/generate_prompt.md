The code defines a prompt template called `PROMPT` for generating questions and answers based on a given document. The template is designed for teachers to come up with detailed questions based on information in the document. The template includes input variables for the document and output variables for the generated question and answer. The code imports the `RegexParser` class from the `langchain.output_parsers.regex` module and uses it to parse the generated question and answer from the template. The code also imports the `PromptTemplate` class from the `langchain.prompts` module and uses it to define the template.
