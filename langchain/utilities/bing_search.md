This code defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around the Bing Search API. The purpose of the script is to enable searching the web using the Bing Search API and parsing the results. The `BingSearchAPIWrapper` class has a `run` method that takes a query as input and returns the search results as a string. The script also includes a `results` method that is used to return metadata about the search results as a list of dictionaries with the keys `snippet`, `title`, and `link`. To use the script, you need to obtain an API key from the Bing Search website and set it as an environment variable. The script includes a `validate_environment` method that is used to validate that the API key and endpoint exist in the environment, and a `get_from_dict_or_env` method that is used to get a value from a dictionary or environment variable.
