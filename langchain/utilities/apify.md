The code you provided defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around the Zapier NLA API. The purpose of the script is to enable LangChain to interact with the Zapier NLA API. The `ZapierNLAWrapper` class has several methods, including `list`, `run`, `preview`, `run_as_str`, `preview_as_str`, and `list_as_str`, that are used to retrieve a list of exposed actions associated with the current user, execute an action identified by its ID, and return a preview of the parameters that have been guessed by the AI, among other things. The `ZapierNLAWrapper` class also has several input parameters, including `zapier_nla_api_key`, `zapier_nla_oauth_access_token`, and `zapier_nla_api_base`, that are used to configure the Zapier NLA API and the wrapper. The `run` and `preview` methods require an `action_id` and `instructions` as inputs, and return a dictionary containing the results of the executed action or the guessed parameters, respectively. The `run_as_str`, `preview_as_str`, and `list_as_str` methods are similar to their counterparts, but return a stringified version of the JSON for inserting back into an LLM.

The code you provided defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around the Apify API. The purpose of the script is to enable LangChain to interact with the Apify API. The `ApifyWrapper` class has two methods, `call_actor` and `acall_actor`, that are used to run an Actor on the Apify platform and wait for results to be ready. The `ApifyWrapper` class also has several input parameters, including `apify_api_token`, `build`, `memory_mbytes`, and `timeout_secs`, that are used to configure the Apify API and the wrapper. The `call_actor` and `acall_actor` methods require an `actor_id`, `run_input`, and `dataset_mapping_function` as inputs, and return an `ApifyDatasetLoader` object that will fetch the records from the Actor run's default dataset.
