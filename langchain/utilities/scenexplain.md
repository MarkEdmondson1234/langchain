This code defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around the SceneXplain API. The purpose of the script is to enable describing images using the SceneXplain API. The `SceneXplainAPIWrapper` class has a `run` method that takes an image as input and returns a description of the image as a string. The script also includes a `validate_environment` method that is used to validate that the API key exists in the environment, and a `get_from_dict_or_env` method that is used to get a value from a dictionary or environment variable. To use the script, you need to obtain an API key from the SceneXplain website and set it as an environment variable.
