# Summary
This code defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around various APIs, including the Wolfram Alpha API, SceneXplain API, and Bing Search API. The purpose of the script is to enable querying these APIs and parsing the results.

## Functions
The script includes several classes that wrap different APIs. Each class has a `run` method that takes input and returns the result of the query as a string. The script also includes a `validate_environment` method that is used to validate that the API key and endpoint exist in the environment, and a `get_from_dict_or_env` method that is used to get a value from a dictionary or environment variable.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
Each `run` method takes different input depending on the API being called. The output of each `run` method is a string that represents the result of the query. The `results` method in the `BingSearchAPIWrapper` class returns metadata about the search results as a list of dictionaries with the keys `snippet`, `title`, and `link`.

The `validate_environment` method takes a dictionary of values and returns a dictionary with the same values, after validating that the API key and endpoint exist in the environment.

The `get_from_dict_or_env` method takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value associated with the key in the dictionary. If the key is not in the dictionary, it checks if the key is an environment variable and returns the value of the environment variable if it exists.

Overall, the script provides a convenient way to query various APIs and parse the results. To use the script, you need to obtain API keys and set them as environment variables.

This code defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around the Google Search API. The purpose of the script is to enable searching the web using the Google Search API and parsing the results. The `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper` class has a `run` method that takes a query as input and returns the search results as a string. The script also includes a `results` method that is used to return metadata about the search results as a list of dictionaries with the keys `snippet`, `title`, and `link`. To use the script, you need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console and set it as an environment variable. The script includes a `validate_environment` method that is used to validate that the API key and endpoint exist in the environment, and a `get_from_dict_or_env` method that is used to get a value from a dictionary or environment variable.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
The `run` method takes a query as input and returns the search results as a string. The `results` method takes a query and the number of results to return as input, and returns metadata about the search results as a list of dictionaries with the keys `snippet`, `title`, and `link`.
