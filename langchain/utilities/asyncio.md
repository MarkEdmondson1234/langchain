The code you provided defines a utility script that provides shims for asyncio features that may be missing from older Python versions. The purpose of the script is to enable compatibility with older versions of Python that may not have certain asyncio features. The script includes a single function, `asyncio_timeout`, which is imported from either `async_timeout` or `asyncio` depending on the version of Python being used. The function is used to set a timeout for an asyncio coroutine. The script also includes a list of all the functions that can be imported from the script, which in this case is just `asyncio_timeout`.
