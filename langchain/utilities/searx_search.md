This code defines a utility script that provides a wrapper around the Serper.dev Google Search API. The purpose of the script is to enable querying the Google Search API and parsing the results. The script includes several methods for querying the Google Search API related to getting search results. The `results` method runs a query through GoogleSearch and returns the results as a dictionary. The `run` method runs a query through GoogleSearch and parses the results. The `aresults` method runs a query through GoogleSearch asynchronously and returns the results as a dictionary. The `arun` method runs a query through GoogleSearch asynchronously and parses the results. The `_parse_results` method is a helper method that parses the results returned by the GoogleSearch API. The code also includes a utility for using SearxNG meta search API. It provides a way to query the searx API and includes methods for convenience. The `run` and `results` methods are used to query the searx API. Other methods are available for convenience. The code also provides information on how to use the searx search instance to query the API and how to pass parameters to the instance. The code also includes notes on the searxNG fork which is better maintained than the original Searx project and offers more features.

# Summary
This code defines a function that returns a dictionary with default parameters for a search query.

## Functions
The `_get_default_params` function returns a dictionary with default parameters for a search query.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- The `_get_default_params` function takes no input and returns a dictionary with default parameters for a search query.

Please note that the inputs and outputs for each function are further described in the code.

# Summary
This code defines a class called `SearxResults` which is a dictionary-like wrapper around search API results returned by Searx. 

## Functions
The `SearxResults` class has two properties: `results` and `answers`. The `results` property returns the search results as a dictionary, while the `answers` property returns the answers as a dictionary. 

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- The `SearxResults` class takes a string as input, which is the raw result from Searx. 
- The `results` and `answers` properties take no input and return dictionaries. 

Please note that the inputs and outputs for each function are further described in the code.

# Summary
The code defines a class called `SearxSearchWrapper` which is a wrapper for the Searx API. It allows you to query the Searx search engine by providing a host URL and other parameters. The class includes a method called `_searx_api_query` which sends a request to the Searx API and returns the results as a `SearxResults` object.

## Functions
The `SearxSearchWrapper` class includes a single method called `_searx_api_query` which sends a request to the Searx API and returns the results as a `SearxResults` object.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- The `SearxSearchWrapper` class takes several input parameters, including `searx_host`, `unsecure`, `params`, `headers`, `engines`, `categories`, `query_suffix`, `k`, and `aiosession`. The `_searx_api_query` method takes a dictionary of parameters as input and returns a `SearxResults` object as output.

Please note that the inputs and outputs for each function are further described in the code.

# Summary
The code defines two methods called `run` and `arun` which allow you to query the Searx search engine. The `run` method is a synchronous version of the query, while the `arun` method is an asynchronous version. Both methods take several input parameters, including `query`, `engines`, `categories`, `query_suffix`, and `kwargs`. The methods send a request to the Searx API using the `_asearx_api_query` method and return the results as a string.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- The `run` and `arun` methods take several input parameters, including `query`, `engines`, `categories`, `query_suffix`, and `kwargs`. 
- The `run` and `arun` methods return a string as output.

Please note that the inputs and outputs for each function are further described in the code.

The code defines two methods called `results` and `aresults` which allow you to query the Searx search engine and return the results with metadata. The `results` method is a synchronous version of the query, while the `aresults` method is an asynchronous version. Both methods take several input parameters, including `query`, `num_results`, `engines`, `categories`, and `query_suffix`. The methods send a request to the Searx API using the `_asearx_api_query` method and return the results as a list of dictionaries. The dictionaries contain metadata about the search results, such as the title, link, and engines used.
