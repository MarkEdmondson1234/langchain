# Script Purpose
This code defines two abstract classes, `Docstore` and `AddableMixin`, that provide interfaces for accessing and adding documents to a document store. The `Docstore` class includes an abstract `search` method that takes a search string and returns either a string representing the summary of a document or a `Document` object representing the full text of the document. If the document does not exist, the `search` method returns similar entries. The `AddableMixin` class includes an abstract `add` method that takes a dictionary of document names and `Document` objects and adds them to the document store.
