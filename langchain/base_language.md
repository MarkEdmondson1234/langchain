The code you provided defines a base class called BaseLanguageModel for all language models. The class includes four functions: generate_prompt, agenerate_prompt, get_num_tokens, and get_num_tokens_from_messages. The generate_prompt and agenerate_prompt functions take in a list of prompt values and return an LLMResult. The get_num_tokens function gets the number of tokens present in the text, and the get_num_tokens_from_messages function gets the number of tokens in the message. The functions are related in that they all involve working with language models. 

Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.
