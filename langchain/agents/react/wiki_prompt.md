The code you provided is a single line of code that imports the `PromptTemplate` class from the `langchain.prompts.prompt` module. There are no functions or classes defined in the code. Therefore, there are no inputs or outputs to describe.

The code you provided defines a list of examples that represent a conversation between a user and an agent. Each example consists of a question, a series of thoughts, actions, and observations, and a final action that represents the answer to the question. These examples are likely used to train or test a conversational agent's ability to understand and respond to natural language queries. There are no functions or classes defined in the code, so there are no inputs or outputs to describe.

The code you provided defines a list of examples that represent a conversation between a user and an agent. Each example consists of a question, a series of thoughts, actions, and observations, and a final action that represents the answer to the question. These examples are likely used to train or test a conversational agent's ability to understand and respond to natural language queries. The `SUFFIX` variable is defined as a string that is used to format the agent's output. There are no functions or classes defined in the code, so there are no inputs or outputs to describe.

The code you provided defines a variable called `WIKI_PROMPT` that is created by calling the `from_examples` method of the `PromptTemplate` class from the `langchain.prompts.prompt` module. The `from_examples` method takes three arguments: a list of examples, a suffix string, and a list of variable names. The `EXAMPLES` list is defined earlier in the code and contains several examples of conversations between a user and an agent. The `SUFFIX` variable is also defined earlier in the code and is used to format the agent's output. The `["input", "agent_scratchpad"]` list specifies the names of the variables that will be used in the formatted output. There are no functions or classes defined in the code other than the `PromptTemplate` class. Therefore, there are no inputs or outputs to describe for this specific code block.
