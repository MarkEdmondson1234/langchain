The code you provided defines a variable called `TEXTWORLD_PROMPT` that is created by calling the `from_examples` method of the `PromptTemplate` class from the `langchain.prompts.prompt` module. The `from_examples` method takes three arguments: a list of examples, a suffix string, and a list of variable names. The `EXAMPLES` list contains several examples of conversations between a user and an agent in a TextWorld game. The `SUFFIX` variable is used to format the agent's output. The `["input", "agent_scratchpad"]` list specifies the names of the variables that will be used in the formatted output. There are no functions or classes defined in the code other than the `PromptTemplate` class. Therefore, there are no inputs or outputs to describe for this specific code block.
