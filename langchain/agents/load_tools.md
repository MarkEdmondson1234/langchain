This code is a module that loads various tools used by the `langchain` library. It defines several functions that return instances of different `BaseTool` subclasses, such as `PythonREPLTool` and `ShellTool`. It also defines a dictionary `_BASE_TOOLS` that maps tool names to their corresponding functions. Additionally, there is a function `_get_pal_math` that returns a `Tool` instance for solving math problems using a language model.

This code defines several functions that return instances of different `BaseTool` subclasses, such as `Tool` and `WolframAlphaQueryRun`. These functions are used to load various tools used by the `langchain` library, such as APIs for news, podcasts, and movies, as well as tools for solving math problems and reasoning about objects' colors and positions. The functions are stored in dictionaries `_LLM_TOOLS` and `_BASE_TOOLS` that map tool names to their corresponding functions.

The functions are stored in dictionaries `_LLM_TOOLS` and `_BASE_TOOLS` that map tool names to their corresponding functions. The specific functions you asked about are part of the `_EXTRA_OPTIONAL_TOOLS` dictionary and provide tools for searching the web using various APIs and engines, such as Google, Bing, and Searx. They take various keyword arguments as inputs and return instances of `BaseTool`.

This code defines two functions related to loading tools for the `langchain` library. The `load_tools` function takes a list of tool names and optional inputs, and returns a list of instances of the corresponding tools. The `get_all_tool_names` function returns a list of all possible tool names. The functions are organized into several dictionaries that map tool names to their corresponding functions, including `_LLM_TOOLS`, `_BASE_TOOLS`, `_EXTRA_LLM_TOOLS`, and `_EXTRA_OPTIONAL_TOOLS`. The specific functions you asked about are part of the `_EXTRA_OPTIONAL_TOOLS` dictionary and provide tools for searching the web using various APIs and engines, such as Google, Bing, and Searx. They take various keyword arguments as inputs and return instances of `BaseTool`.
