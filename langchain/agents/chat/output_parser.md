This code defines a class `ChatOutputParser` that extends `AgentOutputParser`. It provides a `parse` method that takes a string as input and returns either an `AgentAction` or an `AgentFinish` object. The method checks if the input string contains the string "Final Answer:" in it. If it does, it returns an `AgentFinish` object with the output field set to the text after that string. If it does not contain "Final Answer:", it tries to extract a JSON object from the input string enclosed in triple backticks. If it succeeds, it returns an `AgentAction` object with the action and action_input fields set to the corresponding fields in the JSON object. The input and output of the `parse` method are both strings, and the output is either an `AgentAction` or an `AgentFinish` object.
