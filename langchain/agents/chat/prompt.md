This code defines some constants `PREFIX`, `FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS`, and `SUFFIX`. `PREFIX` is a string that introduces a set of questions that the user must answer. `FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS` is a string that provides instructions for how to use the tools available to the user, which are specified in the `tool_names` variable. The instructions specify that the user must provide a JSON object with an `action` key specifying the name of the tool to use and an `action_input` key specifying the input to the tool. The JSON object must be enclosed in triple braces and should only contain a single action. The `SUFFIX` string provides a closing message for the set of questions. The input and output of these constants are all strings.
