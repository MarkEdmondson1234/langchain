This code defines two toolkits for interacting with APIs: RequestsToolkit and OpenAPIToolkit. RequestsToolkit provides tools for making requests such as GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE. OpenAPIToolkit extends RequestsToolkit and adds a tool for exploring JSON data. The code also imports various modules and classes from the langchain package. The second code you provided defines functions for simplifying and reducing OpenAPI specs. The `reduce_openapi_spec` function takes an OpenAPI spec as input and returns a simplified version of it, including only GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE endpoints and stripping down the documentation to required request arguments and happy path responses. The `dereference_refs` function is used to replace any references in the spec so that complete documentation is retrieved.
