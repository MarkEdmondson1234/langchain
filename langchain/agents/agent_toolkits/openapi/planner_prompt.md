The code you provided defines a prompt template for an API planner tool and an API controller tool. The API planner tool generates a plan of API calls to assist with user queries against an API, while the API controller tool executes a sequence of API calls and returns the final response. The code includes examples of user queries and their corresponding plans, as well as tools for executing requests against the API. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.

The code you provided defines tools for planning and executing API requests. The API planner tool generates a plan of API calls to assist with user queries against an API, while the API controller tool executes a sequence of API calls and returns the final response. The code also includes a prompt template for orchestrating planning and execution, as well as a tool for extracting information from API responses. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.
