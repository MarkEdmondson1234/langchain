The code you provided defines an agent designed to answer questions by making web requests to an API given the openapi spec. The agent uses tools for planning and executing API requests, as well as a prompt template for orchestrating planning and execution, and tools for extracting information from API responses. The API planner tool generates a plan of API calls to assist with user queries against an API, while the API controller tool executes a sequence of API calls and returns the final response. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code. The openapi agent is designed to find the base URL needed to make the request, find the relevant paths needed to answer the question, find the required parameters needed to make the request, and make the requests needed to answer the question. The agent uses the exact parameter names as listed in the spec, and does not make up any names or abbreviate the names of parameters. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.
