This code defines two toolkits for interacting with APIs: RequestsToolkit and OpenAPIToolkit. RequestsToolkit provides tools for making requests such as GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE. OpenAPIToolkit extends RequestsToolkit and adds a tool for exploring JSON data. The code also imports various modules and classes from the langchain package.
