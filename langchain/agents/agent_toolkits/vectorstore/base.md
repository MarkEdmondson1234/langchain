The code you provided defines two functions, `create_vectorstore_agent` and `create_vectorstore_router_agent`, that create agents for interacting with vector stores. The functions take a language model (`llm`), a toolkit for interacting with the vector store (`toolkit`), and optional keyword arguments for constructing the agent. The functions return an `AgentExecutor` object that can be used to execute the agent. The agents are constructed using a `ZeroShotAgent` from the `langchain.agents.mrkl.base` module to provide access to the vector store within the agent's language model. The agent's prompts are defined in the `PREFIX` and `ROUTER_PREFIX` variables from the `langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.vectorstore.prompt` module. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code comments.
