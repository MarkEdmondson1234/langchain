The code you provided defines prompts for two different types of agents. The `PREFIX` variable defines a prompt for an agent designed to answer questions about sets of documents. The agent has access to tools for interacting with the documents, and the inputs to the tools are questions. Sometimes, the agent will be asked to provide sources for its answers, in which case it should use the appropriate tool to do so. If the question does not seem relevant to any of the tools provided, the agent should return "I don't know" as the answer. The `ROUTER_PREFIX` variable defines a prompt for an agent designed to answer general questions. The agent has access to tools for interacting with different sources, and the inputs to the tools are questions. The agent's main task is to decide which of the tools is relevant for answering the question at hand. For complex questions, the agent can break the question down into sub questions and use tools to answer the sub questions. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.
