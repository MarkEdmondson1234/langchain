The code you provided defines two toolkits for interacting with vector stores. The `VectorStoreToolkit` toolkit provides tools for interacting with a single vector store, while the `VectorStoreRouterToolkit` provides tools for routing between multiple vector stores. Both toolkits define a `get_tools()` function that returns a list of `BaseTool` objects for interacting with the vector stores. The `VectorStoreInfo` class defines information about a vector store, including its name, description, and the vector store object itself. The `VectorStoreQATool` and `VectorStoreQAWithSourcesTool` classes provide tools for querying a vector store using a language model, with and without sources respectively. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.
