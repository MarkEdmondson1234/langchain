The code you provided defines an agent toolkit for interacting with vector stores. The toolkit includes two classes, `VectorStoreToolkit` and `VectorStoreRouterToolkit`, which provide tools for querying vector stores using a language model. The `VectorStoreInfo` class defines information about a vector store, including its name, description, and the vector store object itself. The `VectorStoreQATool` and `VectorStoreQAWithSourcesTool` classes provide tools for querying a vector store using a language model, with and without sources respectively. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.
