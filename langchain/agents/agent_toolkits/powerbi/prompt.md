The code you provided defines prompts for a Power BI agent. The prompts include a prefix and suffix for the chat messages, as well as instructions for the agent on how to interact with the Power BI dataset. The prefix includes a description of the agent's capabilities and instructions for how to construct a query to answer a question. The suffix includes a prompt for the user to input a question and instructions for how the agent should use the tools to answer the question. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.

The code you provided includes several scripts for a Power BI agent. The first script defines a toolkit for interacting with a Power BI dataset, including tools for querying, listing, and providing information. The second script defines prompts for the agent, including a prefix and suffix for chat messages and instructions for how to interact with the dataset. The third script defines a Power BI agent that can interact with a user in a conversational chat, constructed from the language model and toolkit. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code comments. The last message seems to be a prompt for the user to provide input to the agent in the form of a JSON blob with a single action.
