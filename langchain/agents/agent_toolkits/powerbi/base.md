The code you provided includes several scripts for a Power BI agent. The first script defines a toolkit for interacting with a Power BI dataset, including tools for querying, listing, and providing information. The second script defines prompts for the agent, including a prefix and suffix for chat messages and instructions for how to interact with the dataset. The third script defines a Power BI agent that can interact with a user in a conversational chat, constructed from the language model and toolkit. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code comments. The last message seems to be a prompt for the user to provide input to the agent in the form of a JSON blob with a single action.
