This code defines a toolkit for interacting with a Power BI dataset. The `PowerBIToolkit` class includes tools for performing actions on the dataset, such as querying, listing, and providing information. The `get_tools` function returns the tools in the toolkit. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code comments.
