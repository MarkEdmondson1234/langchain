The code you provided defines an agent designed to interact with JSON. The agent's goal is to return a final answer by interacting with the JSON. The agent has access to tools for learning more about the JSON it is interacting with, and should only use the information returned by these tools to construct its final answer. The agent should not make up any information that is not contained in the JSON. The agent should only use keys that it knows for a fact exist, and must validate that a key exists by seeing it previously when calling `json_spec_list_keys`. If the agent has not seen a key in one of those responses, it cannot use it. The agent should only add one key at a time to the path, and cannot add multiple keys at once. If the agent encounters a "KeyError", it should go back to the previous key, look at the available keys, and try again. If the question does not seem to be related to the JSON, the agent should return "I don't know" as the answer. The agent should always begin its interaction with the `json_spec_list_keys` tool with input "data" to see what keys exist in the JSON. Note that sometimes the value at a given path is large. In this case, the agent will get an error "Value is a large dictionary, should explore its keys directly". In this case, the agent should ALWAYS follow up by using the `json_spec_list_keys` tool to see what keys exist at that path. The agent should not simply refer the user to the JSON or a section of the JSON, as this is not a valid answer. The inputs and outputs for each function are not explicitly stated in the code.
