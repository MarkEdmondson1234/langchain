This code imports several modules and defines classes and methods for implementing an agent that can respond to structured chat prompts. The `Agent` class is defined in the `langchain.agents.agent` module and is used as a base class for the `LLMChain` and `ZeroShotAgent` classes. The `StructuredChatOutputParserWithRetries` class is defined in the `langchain.agents.structured_chat.output_parser` module and is used for parsing the output of an LLM in a structured chat setting. The `ChatPromptTemplate`, `HumanMessagePromptTemplate`, and `SystemMessagePromptTemplate` classes are defined in the `langchain.prompts.chat` module and are used for formatting the output of the agent. The input and output of these methods and properties are specific to their implementation and are not described in detail here.

This code defines a class called `StructuredChatAgent` that extends the `Agent` class and is used for responding to structured chat prompts. It includes several methods and properties for constructing the agent and formatting its output. The `create_prompt` method creates a prompt template that includes instructions for using the agent's tools and formatting the input. The `from_llm_and_tools` method constructs an agent from a language model and a list of tools. The input and output of these methods and properties are specific to their implementation and are not described in detail here.
