This code defines two classes, `StructuredChatOutputParser` and `StructuredChatOutputParserWithRetries`, that are used for parsing the output of an LLM in a structured chat setting. The `StructuredChatOutputParser` class defines a `parse` method that extracts the action and action input from the LLM output and returns an `AgentAction` or `AgentFinish` object. The `StructuredChatOutputParserWithRetries` class extends `StructuredChatOutputParser` and adds the ability to retry parsing with an `OutputFixingParser`. Both classes have a `get_format_instructions` method that returns a string with instructions for formatting the LLM output. The input and output of these methods and properties are specific to their implementation and are not described in detail here.
