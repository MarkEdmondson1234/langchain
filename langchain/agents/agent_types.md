# AgentType Enum
This code defines an Enum class called `AgentType` that inherits from `str`. It contains several predefined values that represent different types of agents, such as `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` and `CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION`. These values are used to identify the type of agent being used in other parts of the code.
