This code defines a class `SelfAskOutputParser` that extends `AgentOutputParser`. It provides a `parse` method that takes a string as input and returns either an `AgentAction` or an `AgentFinish` object. The method checks if the input string contains the string "Follow up:" in the last line. If it does not, it checks if the last line contains the string "So the final answer is: ". If it does, it returns an `AgentFinish` object with the output field set to the text after that string. If it does contain "Follow up:", it returns an `AgentAction` object with the label "Intermediate Answer" and the text after the colon in the last line. The input and output of the `parse` method are both strings, and the output is either an `AgentAction` or an `AgentFinish` object.
