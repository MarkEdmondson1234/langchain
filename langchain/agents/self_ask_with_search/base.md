This code defines a self-ask-with-search chain that includes a `SelfAskWithSearchAgent` class and a `SelfAskWithSearchChain` class. The `SelfAskWithSearchAgent` class is an agent for the self-ask-with-search paper that extends the `Agent` class and provides methods for creating a prompt and validating tools. The `SelfAskWithSearchChain` class is a chain that does self ask with search and extends the `AgentExecutor` class. It takes a language model and a search chain as input and initializes with a search tool and an agent that uses the language model and the search tool. The purpose of the chain is to generate prompts for the user to answer based on the input and agent scratchpad variables.
