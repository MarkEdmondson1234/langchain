This code defines a class `MRKLOutputParser` that extends `AgentOutputParser`. It provides a `get_format_instructions` method that returns the `FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS` constant imported from `langchain.agents.mrkl.prompt`. It also provides a `parse` method that parses text input and returns an `AgentAction` or `AgentFinish` object, depending on the input. The `FINAL_ANSWER_ACTION` constant is defined as `"Final Answer:"`. The `regex` variable defines a regular expression used to parse the input text. The input and output of these methods and properties are specific to their implementation and are not described in detail here.
