This code defines three constants (`PREFIX`, `FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS`, and `SUFFIX`) used to construct a prompt for the user to answer questions. The `PREFIX` constant provides an introductory message for the prompt, while the `FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS` constant provides instructions for how to format the user's answers. The `SUFFIX` constant provides a message to start the prompt and includes placeholders for the input and scratchpad. There are no functions defined in this code. The input and output of these constants are specific to their implementation and are not described in detail here.
