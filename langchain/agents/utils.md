This code defines a function called `validate_tools_single_input` that takes in a class name and a sequence of tools as inputs and validates whether the tools are single input or not. If a tool is not single input, the function raises a `ValueError`. The function uses the `BaseTool` class from the `langchain.tools.base` module. The inputs and outputs for the function are described in the code.
