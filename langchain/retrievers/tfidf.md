This code defines a class called `TFIDFRetriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever` and `BaseModel`. The purpose of this class is to retrieve relevant documents using TF-IDF. The class has two methods, `get_relevant_documents` and `aget_relevant_documents`, which both take a string query as input and return a list of `Document` objects. The `get_relevant_documents` method is synchronous while `aget_relevant_documents` is asynchronous and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The class also imports `BaseRetriever` and `Document` from different modules. The class has several inputs including `texts` and `tfidf_params`, and several outputs including a list of relevant documents. The class also defines a function called `from_texts` which creates a TF-IDF vectorizer using a list of texts and TF-IDF parameters.
