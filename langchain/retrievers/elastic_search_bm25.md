This code defines a class called `ElasticsearchVectorRetriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever`. The purpose of this class is to provide a wrapper around Elasticsearch vector database. The class has no methods defined, but it imports `Document` from `langchain.docstore.document` and `BaseRetriever` from `langchain.schema`. 

Inputs and outputs:
There are no inputs or outputs for this code, as it simply defines a class.

This code defines a class called `ElasticSearchBM25Retriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever`. The purpose of this class is to provide a wrapper around Elasticsearch vector database. The class has three methods including `create`, `add_texts`, and `get_relevant_documents`. 

- `create`: Creates an Elasticsearch client instance, defines index settings and mappings, and creates the index with the specified settings and mappings.
- `add_texts`: Runs more texts through the embeddings and adds them to the retriever.
- `get_relevant_documents`: Queries the Elasticsearch instance for relevant documents and returns a list of `Document` objects containing the page content from the response.

Inputs and outputs:

- `create`: Inputs an Elasticsearch URL, index name, `k1` and `b` values, and outputs an instance of `ElasticSearchBM25Retriever`.
- `add_texts`: Inputs an iterable of strings and a boolean value for refreshing indices, and outputs a list of ids from adding the texts into the retriever.
- `get_relevant_documents`: Inputs a string query and outputs a list of `Document` objects.

This code defines a method called `get_relevant_documents` which queries an Elasticsearch instance for relevant documents and returns a list of `Document` objects containing the page content from the response. There is also an asynchronous method called `aget_relevant_documents` which is not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`. There are no inputs or outputs defined for `aget_relevant_documents`, but `get_relevant_documents` inputs a string query and outputs a list of `Document` objects.
