This code defines a class called `LLMChainFilter`, which is a subclass of `BaseDocumentCompressor`. The purpose of this class is to filter out documents that are not relevant to the query using an LLM. The class has two methods, `compress_documents` and `acompress_documents`, which both take a sequence of `Document` objects and a string query as input and return a sequence of `Document` objects. The `compress_documents` method is synchronous, while `acompress_documents` is asynchronous and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The class also imports several modules and defines several inputs, including `documents`, `query`, `llm_chain`, `get_input`, and several outputs, including a sequence of filtered `Document` objects. The class also defines several functions, including `_get_default_chain_prompt`, `default_get_input`, and `from_llm`.
