This code defines a class called `LLMChainExtractor`, which is a subclass of `BaseDocumentCompressor`. The purpose of this class is to extract the relevant parts of documents using an LLM chain. The class has two methods, `compress_documents` and `acompress_documents`, which both take a sequence of `Document` objects and a string query as input and return a sequence of `Document` objects. The `compress_documents` method is synchronous, while `acompress_documents` is asynchronous. The class also imports several modules and defines several inputs, including `documents`, `query`, `llm_chain`, `get_input`, and several outputs, including a sequence of compressed `Document` objects. The class also defines several functions, including `_get_default_chain_prompt`, `default_get_input`, and `from_llm`.
