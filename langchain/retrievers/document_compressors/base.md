This code defines an interface for retrieved document compressors. It includes two abstract methods, `compress_documents` and `acompress_documents`, which are both defined in subclasses. The `DocumentCompressorPipeline` class is a subclass of `BaseDocumentCompressor` that uses a pipeline of transformers to compress documents. It has two methods, `compress_documents` and `acompress_documents`, which both take a sequence of `Document` objects and a string query as input and return a sequence of `Document` objects. The class also imports several modules and defines several inputs, including `documents`, `query`, `transformers`, and several outputs, including a sequence of compressed `Document` objects.
