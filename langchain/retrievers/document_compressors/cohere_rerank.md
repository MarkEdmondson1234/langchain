This code defines a class called `CohereRerank` which is a subclass of `BaseDocumentCompressor`. The purpose of this class is to compress documents using the Cohere API. The class has two methods, `compress_documents` and `acompress_documents`, which both take a sequence of `Document` objects and a string query as input and return a sequence of `Document` objects. The `compress_documents` method is synchronous while `acompress_documents` is asynchronous and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The class also imports `BaseDocumentCompressor`, `Document`, and `Client` from different modules. The class has several inputs including `documents`, `query`, `top_n`, and `model`, and several outputs including a sequence of compressed `Document` objects. The class also defines a function called `validate_environment` which validates that the Cohere API key and Python package exist in the environment.
