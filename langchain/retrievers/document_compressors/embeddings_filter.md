This code defines a class called `EmbeddingsFilter`, which is a subclass of `BaseDocumentCompressor`. The purpose of this class is to compress documents using embeddings to filter out documents that are unrelated to the query. The class has two methods, `compress_documents` and `acompress_documents`, which both take a sequence of `Document` objects and a string query as input and return a sequence of `Document` objects. The `compress_documents` method is synchronous, while `acompress_documents` is asynchronous and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The class also imports several modules and defines several inputs, including `documents`, `query`, `embeddings`, `similarity_fn`, `k`, and `similarity_threshold`, and several outputs, including a sequence of compressed `Document` objects. The class also defines a function called `validate_params` which validates the similarity parameters.
