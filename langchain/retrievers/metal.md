This code defines a class called `MetalRetriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever`. The purpose of this class is to retrieve relevant documents using the Metal API. The class has two methods, `get_relevant_documents` and `aget_relevant_documents`, which both take a string query as input and return a list of `Document` objects. The `get_relevant_documents` method is synchronous while `aget_relevant_documents` is asynchronous and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The class also imports `BaseRetriever` and `Document` from different modules. The class has two inputs, `client` and `params`, and several outputs including a list of relevant documents.
