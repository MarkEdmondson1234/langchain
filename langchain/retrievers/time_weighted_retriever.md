This code defines a class called `RecencyWeightedVectorStoreRetriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever`. The purpose of this class is to combine embedding similarity with recency in retrieving values. The class has one private method `_get_hours_passed` which calculates the hours passed between two datetime objects. The class also imports `BaseModel`, `Field`, `Document`, and `VectorStore` from different modules. 

Inputs and outputs:
There are no inputs or outputs defined for the class or its private method.

This code defines a class called `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever` and `BaseModel`. The purpose of this class is to combine embedding similarity with recency in retrieving values. The class has several methods including `_get_combined_score`, `get_salient_docs`, `get_relevant_documents`, and `aget_relevant_documents`. The class also has several inputs including `vectorstore`, `search_kwargs`, `memory_stream`, `decay_rate`, `k`, `other_score_keys`, and `default_salience`. The class has several outputs including a dictionary of salient documents, a list of relevant documents, and a list of asynchronous relevant documents.

The code defines two methods, `add_documents` and `aadd_documents`, which add documents to a vectorstore. Both methods take a list of `Document` objects as input and return a list of strings. The `add_documents` method is synchronous while `aadd_documents` is asynchronous. Both methods avoid mutating the input documents and assign metadata including `last_accessed_at`, `created_at`, and `buffer_idx` to each document. The `buffer_idx` is used to keep track of the documents in the memory stream.
