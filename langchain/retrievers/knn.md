This code defines a class called `KNNRetriever` which is a subclass of `BaseRetriever` and `BaseModel`. The purpose of this class is to retrieve relevant documents using KNN. The class has two methods, `get_relevant_documents` and `aget_relevant_documents`, which both take a string query as input and return a list of `Document` objects. The `get_relevant_documents` method is synchronous while `aget_relevant_documents` is asynchronous and raises a `NotImplementedError`. The class also imports `BaseRetriever`, `BaseModel`, `Embeddings`, and `Document` from different modules. The class has several inputs including `contexts`, `embeddings`, `texts`, `k`, and `relevancy_threshold`, and several outputs including a numpy array of embeddings, a list of relevant documents, and a list of asynchronous relevant documents. The class also defines a function called `create_index` which creates an embedding index using a list of contexts and embeddings.
