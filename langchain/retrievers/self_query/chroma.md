# heading
This code defines a class called `ChromaTranslator` that converts internal query language to a valid Chroma query.

## functions
The class has several methods, including `visit_operation`, `visit_comparison`, and `visit_structured_query`, which all take different types of input and return a dictionary or tuple.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
`visit_operation` takes an `Operation` object as input and returns a dictionary. `visit_comparison` takes a `Comparison` object as input and returns a dictionary. `visit_structured_query` takes a `StructuredQuery` object as input and returns a tuple containing a string and a dictionary.

The inputs to the class include `allowed_operators` and `allowed_comparators`, and the output is a valid Chroma query. The code uses the `langchain` module and imports several classes and functions from `langchain.chains.query_constructor.ir`.
