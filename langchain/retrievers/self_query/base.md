This code defines a retriever that generates and executes structured queries over its own data source. It imports several modules and classes, including `LLMChain`, `BaseLanguageModel`, `load_query_constructor_chain`, `StructuredQuery`, `Visitor`, `AttributeInfo`, `PineconeTranslator`, `ChromaTranslator`, `BaseRetriever`, `Document`, `Chroma`, `Pinecone`, and `VectorStore`. The code also defines a function called `_get_builtin_translator` that gets the translator class corresponding to the vector store class. The inputs to the function include `vectorstore_cls`, and the output is a translator object.

This code defines a retriever that wraps around a vector store and uses an LLM to generate and execute structured queries over its own data source. The retriever is called `SelfQueryRetriever` and inherits from `BaseRetriever` and `BaseModel`. The code imports several modules and classes, including `LLMChain`, `BaseLanguageModel`, `load_query_constructor_chain`, `StructuredQuery`, `Visitor`, `AttributeInfo`, `PineconeTranslator`, `ChromaTranslator`, `BaseRetriever`, `Document`, `Chroma`, `Pinecone`, and `VectorStore`. The code also defines a function called `_get_builtin_translator` that gets the translator class corresponding to the vector store class. 

The `SelfQueryRetriever` class has several inputs, including `vectorstore`, `llm_chain`, `search_type`, `search_kwargs`, `structured_query_translator`, and `verbose`, and several outputs, including a list of relevant documents. The class has several methods, including `get_relevant_documents`, `aget_relevant_documents`, and `from_llm`, which all take different types of input and return a list of relevant documents or a retriever object. 

The `get_relevant_documents` method takes a string query as input and returns a list of relevant documents. The `from_llm` method is a class method that takes several inputs, including `llm`, `vectorstore`, `document_contents`, `metadata_field_info`, `structured_query_translator`, and `chain_kwargs`, and returns a `SelfQueryRetriever` object.
