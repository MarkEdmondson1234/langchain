# Code Summary
This code defines a class called EmbeddingsRedundantFilter that is used to filter redundant documents by comparing their embeddings. It also defines a few helper functions that are used in this process. 

## Functions
- get_stateful_documents: This function takes in a list of Documents and returns a list of _DocumentWithState objects.
- _filter_similar_embeddings: This function is used to filter redundant documents based on the similarity of their embeddings.
- _get_embeddings_from_stateful_docs: This function takes in a list of _DocumentWithState objects and returns a list of embeddings.
- transform_documents: This function takes in a list of Documents and returns a filtered list of Documents.

# Inputs and Outputs
- get_stateful_documents: This function takes in a list of Documents and returns a list of _DocumentWithState objects.
- _filter_similar_embeddings: This function takes in a list of embeddings, a similarity function, and a threshold and returns a list of indices of the embeddings that are not redundant.
- _get_embeddings_from_stateful_docs: This function takes in a list of _DocumentWithState objects and returns a list of embeddings.
- transform_documents: This function takes in a list of Documents and returns a filtered list of Documents. The inputs are the list of Documents and the outputs are the filtered list of Documents.
