# heading
This code defines a few classes and variables related to autonomous agents and natural language processing.

## functions
The classes defined in this code include:
- `BabyAGI`: an autonomous agent that generates and executes tasks using the `TaskCreationChain`, `TaskExecutionChain`, and `TaskPrioritizationChain` classes
- `TaskExecutionChain`: a chain for executing tasks using a language model
- `AutoGPTMemory`: a subclass of `BaseChatMemory` used for chat memory and context retrieval
- `BaseTool`: a base class for tools used in natural language processing

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `BabyAGI`:
  - Inputs:
    - `llm`: a BaseLanguageModel object
    - `vectorstore`: a VectorStore object
    - `verbose`: a boolean value for verbosity
    - `task_execution_chain`: an optional Chain object for executing tasks
  - Outputs:
    - an instance of the BabyAGI class
  
- `TaskExecutionChain`:
  - Inputs:
    - `llm`: a BaseLanguageModel object
    - `verbose`: a boolean value for verbosity
  - Outputs:
    - an instance of the TaskExecutionChain class
  
- `AutoGPTMemory`:
  - Inputs:
    - `retriever`: a VectorStoreRetriever object for connecting to a vector store
  - Outputs:
    - an instance of the AutoGPTMemory class
  
- `BaseTool`:
  - Inputs:
    - none
  - Outputs:
    - an instance of the BaseTool class

The `FINISH_NAME` variable is simply a string constant.

Overall, this code provides a foundation for building autonomous agents that can generate and execute tasks using natural language processing techniques.

This code defines the `PromptGenerator` class, which is used for generating custom prompt strings based on constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations. The `PromptGenerator` class has several methods for adding constraints, tools, resources, and performance evaluations, as well as generating a prompt string. The `_generate_numbered_list` method generates a numbered list from given items based on the item type, while the `_generate_command_string` method generates a command string for a given tool. The `generate_prompt_string` method generates a prompt string based on the constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations added to the `PromptGenerator` object.

This code defines a function called `get_prompt` that generates a prompt string based on various constraints, commands, resources, and performance evaluations. The function takes a list of `BaseTool` objects as input and returns the generated prompt string as output. The `PromptGenerator` class is used to add constraints, tools, resources, and performance evaluations to the prompt generator object, and the `generate_prompt_string` method of the `PromptGenerator` class is used to generate the prompt string.
