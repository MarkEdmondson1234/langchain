This code defines the `AutoGPTPrompt` class, which is a prompt generator for interacting with an Auto-GPT model in a chatbot-like manner. The class has a `construct_full_prompt` method that constructs a full prompt for the Auto-GPT model based on a list of goals, and a `format_messages` method that formats messages for the Auto-GPT model based on various inputs, including the memory, previous messages, and user input. The code imports various modules and classes from the `langchain` package, including `BaseChatPromptTemplate`, `BaseMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `SystemMessage`, `BaseTool`, `VectorStoreRetriever`, and `AutoGPTOutputParser`, and uses the `pydantic` module for validation.
