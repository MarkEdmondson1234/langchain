This code defines the `TaskExecutionChain` class, which is a chain for executing tasks using a language model. The `TaskExecutionChain` class has a method called `from_llm` which initializes the chain with a language model and a prompt template for executing tasks. The `from_llm` method takes in a language model and a boolean value for verbosity and returns an instance of the `TaskExecutionChain` class.
