# Code Summary

## Purpose
This code defines the `BabyAGI` class, which is an autonomous agent that uses the `TaskCreationChain`, `TaskExecutionChain`, and `TaskPrioritizationChain` classes from the `langchain.experimental.autonomous_agents.baby_agi` module to generate and execute tasks.

## Functions
There are no standalone functions defined in this code.

## Inputs and Outputs
There are no inputs or outputs for this code, as it simply defines the `BabyAGI` class for use in other scripts.

This code defines the `BabyAGI` class, which is an autonomous agent that uses the `TaskCreationChain`, `TaskExecutionChain`, and `TaskPrioritizationChain` classes from the `langchain.experimental.autonomous_agents.baby_agi` module to generate and execute tasks. The `BabyAGI` class has several methods for adding tasks, printing task lists, prioritizing tasks, executing tasks, and running the agent. The `get_next_task` method gets the next task based on the result, task description, and objective, while the `prioritize_tasks` method prioritizes tasks based on the current task ID and objective. The `execute_task` method executes a task based on the objective, task, and context, and the `_get_top_tasks` method gets the top tasks based on a query and k value. The `_call` method runs the agent and takes in inputs and a callback manager for the chain run.
