# Summary
This code imports various modules and classes from the `langchain` package, including `LLMChain`, `BaseLanguageModel`, `PromptTemplate`, `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever`, `BaseMemory`, and `Document`. It also imports the `logging` module. The purpose of the code is to provide a framework for building language models and chatbots using these modules and classes.

# Functions
There are no functions defined in this code.

# Inputs and Outputs
There are no inputs or outputs defined in this code.

This code defines the `GenerativeAgentMemory` class, which is a memory module for a language model or chatbot. The class has methods for generating "insights" based on recent observations, as well as a `pause_to_reflect` method that triggers reflection on recent observations and generates insights. The code imports various modules and classes from the `langchain` package, including `BaseMemory`, `BaseLanguageModel`, `PromptTemplate`, `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever`, and `Document`. It also imports the `logging` module.

# Summary
This code defines several methods for the `GenerativeAgentMemory` class, which is a memory module for a language model or chatbot. The methods include `_score_memory_importance`, which scores the importance of a given memory; `add_memory`, which adds an observation or memory to the agent's memory; `fetch_memories`, which fetches related memories; `format_memories_detail`, which formats relevant memories with their creation times; `format_memories_simple`, which formats relevant memories as a semicolon-separated string; `_get_memories_until_limit`, which reduces the number of tokens in the documents; and `memory_variables`, which returns the input keys that this memory class will load dynamically.

# Functions
The functions are as follows:
- `_score_memory_importance`: Scores the absolute importance of the given memory.
- `add_memory`: Adds an observation or memory to the agent's memory.
- `fetch_memories`: Fetches related memories.
- `format_memories_detail`: Formats relevant memories with their creation times.
- `format_memories_simple`: Formats relevant memories as a semicolon-separated string.
- `_get_memories_until_limit`: Reduces the number of tokens in the documents.
- `memory_variables`: Returns the input keys that this memory class will load dynamically.

# Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs for each function are as follows:
- `_score_memory_importance`: Inputs a memory content string and outputs a float score.
- `add_memory`: Inputs a memory content string and outputs a list of strings.
- `fetch_memories`: Inputs an observation string and outputs a list of `Document` objects.
- `format_memories_detail`: Inputs a list of `Document` objects and outputs a formatted string.
- `format_memories_simple`: Inputs a list of `Document` objects and outputs a semicolon-separated string.
- `_get_memories_until_limit`: Inputs an integer number of consumed tokens and outputs a formatted string.
- `memory_variables`: Outputs a list of strings.

# Summary
This code defines several methods for the `GenerativeAgentMemory` class, which is a memory module for a language model or chatbot. The methods include `memory_variables`, which returns the input keys that this memory class will load dynamically; `load_memory_variables`, which returns key-value pairs given the text input to the chain; `save_context`, which saves the context of this model run to memory; and `clear`, which clears memory contents.

# Functions
The functions are as follows:
- `memory_variables`: Returns the input keys that this memory class will load dynamically.
- `load_memory_variables`: Returns key-value pairs given the text input to the chain.
- `save_context`: Saves the context of this model run to memory.
- `clear`: Clears memory contents.

# Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs for each function are as follows:
- `memory_variables`: Outputs a list of strings.
- `load_memory_variables`: Inputs a dictionary of inputs and outputs a dictionary of key-value pairs.
- `save_context`: Inputs a dictionary of inputs and a dictionary of outputs.
- `clear`: No inputs or outputs.
