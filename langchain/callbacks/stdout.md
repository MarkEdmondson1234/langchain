The code defines a callback handler called `StdOutCallbackHandler` that prints to standard output. The handler has several functions that are called during different stages of a language model run, including `on_llm_start`, `on_llm_end`, `on_llm_new_token`, `on_llm_error`, `on_chain_start`, `on_chain_end`, `on_chain_error`, `on_tool_start`, `on_agent_action`, `on_tool_end`, `on_tool_error`, `on_text`, and `on_agent_finish`. These functions update the response dictionary with relevant metadata and add the response to a list of records. The `on_llm_start` function prints out the prompts, while the `on_llm_end` function does nothing. The `on_chain_start` function prints out that we are entering a chain, while the `on_chain_end` function prints out that we finished a chain. The `on_tool_start` function does nothing, while the `on_agent_action` function runs on agent action. The `on_tool_end` function prints out observation if it is not the final action, and the `on_tool_error` function does nothing. The `on_text` function runs when the agent ends, while the `on_agent_finish` function runs on agent end. If `stream_logs` is True, the response is logged to the ClearML console.
