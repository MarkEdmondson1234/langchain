The code defines several functions for a language model (LLM) run, including `import_comet_ml`, `_get_experiment`, `_fetch_text_complexity_metrics`, and `_summarize_metrics_for_generated_outputs`. These functions import necessary packages and define functionality for logging and summarizing metrics related to the LLM run. The code also imports several modules from langchain and defines a constant variable `LANGCHAIN_MODEL_NAME`.

The code defines a CometCallbackHandler class that logs to Comet during a language model run. The class has several parameters, including job_type, project_name, tags, task_name, visualize, complexity_metrics, and stream_logs. The class utilizes associated callback methods and formats the input of each callback function with metadata regarding the state of the language model run, and adds the response to the list of records for both the {method}_records and action. It then logs the response to Comet. The code also defines several functions, including _init_resp, on_llm_start, and on_llm_new_token, which run during different stages of the language model run and update metadata and response records.

The summarized code you provided defines several callback functions that run during different stages of a language model run and update metadata and response records. These functions include on_chain_end, on_chain_error, on_tool_start, on_tool_end, on_tool_error, on_text, on_agent_finish, on_agent_action, and _get_complexity_metrics. Each function has specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments.

The summarized code you provided defines several functions that are used to log data to Comet during a language model run. These functions include _get_complexity_metrics, _get_custom_metrics, flush_tracker, _log_stream, and _log_model. Each function has specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments.

The code you provided defines several functions that are used to log data to Comet during a language model run. These functions include _log_session, _log_text_metrics, _log_visualizations, and _reset. Each function has specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. The _log_session function logs session data to Comet, including a cleaned dataframe and low-level records as a JSON file. The _log_text_metrics function logs text metrics to Comet, and the _log_visualizations function logs visualizations to Comet. The _reset function resets the parameters for the language model run.

The summarized code you provided defines two functions: _create_session_analysis_dataframe and _get_llm_parameters. The _create_session_analysis_dataframe function creates a Pandas dataframe that summarizes the session data for a language model run. The _get_llm_parameters function retrieves the low-level model parameters for the language model run. The code also initializes several parameters for the language model run and creates a temporary directory.
