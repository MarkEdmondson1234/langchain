This code defines a class called `StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler` which is used for handling callbacks for streaming. It has methods for handling LLM start, new token, end, and error events, as well as chain start, end, and error events, tool start, end, and error events, and arbitrary text and agent finish events. The class inherits from `BaseCallbackHandler` and uses `AgentAction`, `AgentFinish`, `LLMResult` from `langchain.schema`. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
