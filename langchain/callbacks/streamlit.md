This code defines a class called `StreamlitCallbackHandler` which is a callback handler that logs to Streamlit. The class has methods for handling LLM start, new token, end, and error events, as well as chain start, end, and error events, tool start, end, and error events, text events, and agent action and finish events. The class inherits from `BaseCallbackHandler` and uses `AgentAction`, `AgentFinish`, and `LLMResult` from `langchain.schema`. The class keeps track of a streamlit area for displaying tokens and a stream for storing tokens. The methods print out prompts, log agent actions and finishes, and print out chains and observations.
