This code defines a function called `get_openai_token_cost_for_model` which calculates the cost of OpenAI tokens for a given model, number of tokens, and whether it is a completion or not. The function uses a dictionary called `MODEL_COST_PER_1K_TOKENS` to look up the cost per 1000 tokens for each model. The function raises a `ValueError` if the provided model name is not in the dictionary. The function returns the cost of the tokens as a float.

This code defines a class called `OpenAICallbackHandler` which is used for tracking OpenAI info. It has methods for handling LLM start, new token, end, and error events, as well as chain start, end, and error events, tool start, end, and error events, and agent action and finish events. The class inherits from `BaseCallbackHandler` and uses `AgentAction`, `AgentFinish`, `LLMResult` from `langchain.schema`. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code. The class keeps track of the total number of tokens used, the number of prompt tokens and completion tokens used, the number of successful requests, and the total cost in USD.
