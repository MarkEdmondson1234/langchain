# LangChainTracerV2 Summary

The LangChainTracerV2 class is a subclass of LangChainTracer that provides additional functionality for persisting sessions and loading sessions from the LangChain API. The implementation includes several functions, including _get_headers and _get_endpoint, which are used to get the headers and endpoint for the LangChain API. The code also imports several Pydantic schemas, including ChainRun, LLMRun, RunCreate, ToolRun, TracerSession, TracerSessionBase, TracerSessionV2, and TracerSessionV2Create, which are used to define the structure of data objects that are used to record the execution of LangChain runs. Finally, the code imports the BaseTracer class from the langchain.callbacks.tracers.base module, which is used as a base class for the Tracer implementation.

## Functions
- load_default_session: Loads the default tracing session and sets it as the Tracer's session.
- _convert_run: Converts a run to a Run.
- _persist_run: Persists a run.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
## load_default_session
- Inputs: None.
- Outputs: Returns a TracerSessionV2 object.

## _convert_run
- Inputs: A run object of type LLMRun, ChainRun, or ToolRun.
- Outputs: Returns a RunCreate object.

## _persist_run
- Inputs: A run object of type LLMRun, ChainRun, or ToolRun.
- Outputs: None.

The code defines the BaseTracer class, which is a base interface for tracers. It includes functions for persisting runs and tracing sessions, as well as functions for starting and ending traces for runs. The class also includes a function for getting the execution order for a run. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

The class also includes a function for getting the execution order for a run. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. Additionally, there are several callback functions for different types of runs (LLM and chain runs) that start and end traces for those runs, and handle errors.
