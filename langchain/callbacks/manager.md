The code you provided defines several context managers that are used to manage callback handlers and tracers during a language model run. These context managers include get_openai_callback, tracing_enabled, and tracing_v2_enabled. Each context manager has specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. These context managers are used to manage the behavior of the language model during a run.

The code you provided defines several event handling functions that are used to manage callbacks during a language model run. These functions include _handle_event, _ahandle_event_for_handler, and _ahandle_event. Each function has specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. These functions are used to manage the behavior of the language model during a run. The code also defines a TypeVar named BRM, which is used to specify the type of a BaseRunManager object.

The code you provided defines several classes that are used to manage callbacks during a language model run. These classes include BaseRunManager, RunManager, AsyncRunManager, and CallbackManagerForLLMRun. Each class has specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. These classes are used to manage the behavior of the language model during a run, with different classes providing different levels of synchronization and support for asynchronous operations.

The code you provided defines two classes: AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun and CallbackManagerForChainRun. AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun is an async callback manager for LLM run, and CallbackManagerForChainRun is a callback manager for chain run. Each class has several functions with specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. These classes are used to manage callbacks during a language model run, with AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun providing support for asynchronous operations and CallbackManagerForChainRun providing support for chain runs.

The code you provided defines two classes: AsyncCallbackManagerForChainRun and CallbackManagerForToolRun. AsyncCallbackManagerForChainRun is an async callback manager for chain run, and CallbackManagerForToolRun is a callback manager for tool run. Each class has several functions with specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. These classes are used to manage callbacks during a language model run, with AsyncCallbackManagerForChainRun providing support for asynchronous operations and CallbackManagerForToolRun providing support for tool runs.

The code you provided defines two classes: AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun and CallbackManager. AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun is an async callback manager for tool run, and CallbackManager is a callback manager that can be used to handle callbacks from langchain. Each class has several functions with specific inputs and outputs, which are described in the code comments. These classes are used to manage callbacks during a language model run, with AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun providing support for asynchronous operations and CallbackManager providing support for tool runs.

This code defines the AsyncCallbackManager class, which is an async callback manager that can be used to handle callbacks from LangChain. The class has three async functions: on_llm_start, on_chain_start, and on_tool_start, which run when LLM starts running, when chain starts running, and when tool starts running, respectively. Each function takes in specific inputs and returns an instance of a corresponding AsyncCallbackManager subclass. The class also has a configure function that can be used to configure the callback manager. Finally, the code defines a type variable T that can be either CallbackManager or AsyncCallbackManager.

This code defines the configure function, which is used to configure the callback manager. The function takes in a callback_manager_cls argument, which is a type variable that can be either CallbackManager or AsyncCallbackManager. The function also takes in inheritable_callbacks and local_callbacks arguments, which are optional and can be used to specify a list of handlers to be used for the callback manager. The function also takes in a verbose argument, which is optional and can be used to enable verbose output. The function creates an instance of the callback manager class specified by callback_manager_cls and adds handlers to it based on the inputs. Finally, the function returns the configured callback manager instance.
