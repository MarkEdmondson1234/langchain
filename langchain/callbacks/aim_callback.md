This code defines a function called `import_aim` which imports the `aim` package and returns it. If the package is not installed, it raises an ImportError with instructions on how to install it. The code also imports several packages and modules, including `copy`, `typing`, `langchain.callbacks.base`, and `langchain.schema`.

This code defines a class called `BaseMetadataCallbackHandler` which handles the metadata and associated function states for callbacks. The class has several attributes, including `step`, `starts`, `ends`, `errors`, `text_ctr`, `ignore_llm_`, `ignore_chain_`, `ignore_agent_`, `always_verbose_`, `chain_starts`, `chain_ends`, `llm_starts`, `llm_ends`, `llm_streams`, `tool_starts`, `tool_ends`, and `agent_ends`, which keep track of the number of times certain methods have been called and whether to ignore certain types of callbacks. The class also has several methods, including `get_custom_callback_meta` and `reset_callback_meta`, which return a dictionary of the metadata and reset the metadata, respectively. The code imports several packages and modules, including `typing`, `langchain.callbacks.base`, and `langchain.schema`. 

## Functions
- `reset_callback_meta`: Resets the callback metadata. 
- `get_custom_callback_meta`: Returns a dictionary of the metadata. 

# Inputs and Outputs for Each Function
## reset_callback_meta
### Inputs
- None

### Outputs
- None

## get_custom_callback_meta
### Inputs
- None

### Outputs
- A dictionary of the metadata.

This code defines a class called `AimCallbackHandler` which logs to Aim. The class inherits from `BaseMetadataCallbackHandler` and `BaseCallbackHandler`. The class has several attributes, including `repo`, `experiment_name`, `system_tracking_interval`, `log_system_params`, `_run`, and `action_records`. The class also has several methods, including `setup`, `on_llm_start`, and `on_llm_end`, which are associated callback methods that format the input of each callback function with metadata regarding the state of LLM run and then logs the response to Aim. The code imports several packages and modules, including `typing`, `langchain.callbacks.base`, `langchain.schema`, and `aim`. 

## Functions
- `setup`: Initializes the callback handler. 
- `on_llm_start`: Runs when LLM starts. 
- `on_llm_end`: Runs when LLM ends running. 

# Inputs and Outputs for Each Function
## setup
### Inputs
- `repo` (optional): Aim repository path or Repo object to which Run object is bound. If skipped, default Repo is used. 
- `experiment_name` (optional): Sets Run's `experiment` property. 'default' if not specified. Can be used later to query runs/sequences. 
- `system_tracking_interval` (optional): Sets the tracking interval in seconds for system usage metrics (CPU, Memory, etc.). Set to `None` to disable system metrics tracking.
- `log_system_params` (optional): Enable/Disable logging of system params such as installed packages, git info, environment variables, etc.

### Outputs
- None

## on_llm_start
### Inputs
- `serialized`: A dictionary containing the serialized input to LLM. 
- `prompts`: A list of prompts to LLM. 

### Outputs
- None

## on_llm_end
### Inputs
- `response`: An LLMResult object containing the response from LLM. 

### Outputs
- None

This code defines several methods that are associated callback methods for different events during the execution of a program. These events include the generation of a new token, errors, the start and end of a chain, the start and end of a tool, the end of an agent, and an agent action. Each method logs the response to Aim. The code imports several packages and modules, including `typing`, `langchain.callbacks.base`, `langchain.schema`, and `aim`. 

## Functions
- `on_llm_new_token`: Runs when LLM generates a new token.
- `on_llm_error`: Runs when LLM errors.
- `on_chain_start`: Runs when chain starts running.
- `on_chain_end`: Runs when chain ends running.
- `on_chain_error`: Runs when chain errors.
- `on_tool_start`: Runs when tool starts running.
- `on_tool_end`: Runs when tool ends running.
- `on_tool_error`: Runs when tool errors.
- `on_text`: Runs when agent is ending.
- `on_agent_finish`: Runs when agent ends running.
- `on_agent_action`: Runs on agent action.

# Inputs and Outputs for Each Function
## on_llm_new_token
### Inputs
- `token`: The new token generated.

### Outputs
- None

## on_llm_error
### Inputs
- `error`: The error that occurred.

### Outputs
- None

## on_chain_start
### Inputs
- `serialized`: A dictionary containing the serialized input to the chain.
- `inputs`: A dictionary containing the inputs to the chain.

### Outputs
- None

## on_chain

This code defines a method called `flush_tracker` which flushes the tracker and resets the session. The method has several arguments, including `repo`, `experiment_name`, `system_tracking_interval`, `log_system_params`, `langchain_asset`, `reset`, and `finish`. The method also has a docstring that provides detailed information on the arguments and returns. The code imports several packages and modules, including `typing`, `langchain.callbacks.base`, `langchain.schema`, and `aim`.
