The code provides a framework for managing and summarizing conversations between humans and AI assistants. It defines several classes, including `ConversationTokenBufferMemory` for storing conversation memory, `PromptTemplate` for defining templates for entity memory conversation, summarization, and entity extraction, and `LLMChain` for language modeling. The code also includes templates for extracting knowledge triples from conversations and summarizing information about entities. The inputs and outputs for each method and template are described in the code.

The code defines a class called `ConversationKGMemory` which is used for storing conversation memory and integrating with an external knowledge graph to store and retrieve information about knowledge triples in the conversation. It has methods for loading and saving memory variables, as well as methods for extracting entities and knowledge triples from the conversation. The class inherits from `BaseChatMemory` and uses a language model (`llm`) and a memory key (`memory_key`) to manage the conversation memory. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.

The code defines methods for updating and saving conversation memory to an external knowledge graph. The `_get_and_update_kg` method retrieves knowledge triples from the conversation history and updates the knowledge graph with them. The `save_context` method saves the conversation context to the memory buffer and updates the knowledge graph. The `clear` method clears the memory contents and the knowledge graph. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
