This code defines two classes: `SummarizerMixin` and `ConversationSummaryMemory`. 

`SummarizerMixin` is a Pydantic model that provides a method `predict_new_summary` to generate a summary of a conversation based on the existing summary and the latest messages. 

`ConversationSummaryMemory` is a subclass of `BaseChatMemory` and `SummarizerMixin`. It includes a `buffer` attribute that stores the conversation history, and methods to load, save, and clear the conversation history. The `load_memory_variables` method returns the conversation history buffer. The `save_context` method saves the input and output to the conversation history buffer, and generates a new summary using `predict_new_summary`. The `clear` method clears the conversation history. The input and output types for each method are described in the code.
