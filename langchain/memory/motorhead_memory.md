# MotorheadMemory Class
This code defines a class `MotorheadMemory` that is a subclass of `BaseChatMemory`. The purpose of this class is to store conversation memory in a buffer. The `init` method initializes the memory by getting the conversation history and context from a server. The `load_memory_variables` method returns the conversation history buffer. The `memory_variables` method returns a list of memory variables. The `save_context` method saves the input and output to the conversation history buffer. The input and output types for each method are described in the code.
