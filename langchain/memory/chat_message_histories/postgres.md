This code defines a class called `PostgresChatMessageHistory` which is used for storing chat message history in PostgreSQL. It has methods for retrieving messages from PostgreSQL, adding user and AI messages, appending messages to the record in PostgreSQL, and clearing session memory from PostgreSQL. The class inherits from `BaseChatMessageHistory` and uses `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `_message_to_dict`, and `messages_from_dict` from `langchain.schema`. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
