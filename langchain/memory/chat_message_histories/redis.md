This code defines a class called `RedisChatMessageHistory` which is used for storing chat message history in Redis. It has methods for retrieving messages from Redis, adding user and AI messages, appending messages to the record in Redis, and clearing session memory from Redis. The class inherits from `BaseChatMessageHistory` and uses `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `_message_to_dict`, `messages_from_dict`, and `messages_to_dict` from `langchain.schema`. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
