The code defines a class called `FileChatMessageHistory` which is used for storing chat message history in a local file. It has methods for retrieving messages from the file, adding user and AI messages, appending messages to the record in the file, and clearing session memory from the file. The class inherits from `BaseChatMessageHistory` and uses `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `messages_from_dict`, and `messages_to_dict` from `langchain.schema`. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
