The code defines a class called `DynamoDBChatMessageHistory` which is used for storing chat message history in AWS DynamoDB. It has methods for retrieving messages from DynamoDB, adding user and AI messages, appending messages to the record in DynamoDB, and clearing session memory from DynamoDB. The class inherits from `BaseChatMessageHistory` and uses `AIMessage`, `HumanMessage`, `_message_to_dict`, `messages_from_dict`, and `messages_to_dict` from `langchain.schema`. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
