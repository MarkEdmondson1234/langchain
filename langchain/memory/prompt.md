# Summary
The code defines three classes: `ConversationEntityMemory`, `PromptTemplate`, and `LLMChain`. `ConversationEntityMemory` is used for extracting and summarizing entities in a conversation and storing them in memory. `PromptTemplate` is used for defining templates for entity memory conversation, summarization, and entity extraction. `LLMChain` is used for language modeling. 

## Functions
`ConversationEntityMemory` has the following methods:
- `load_memory_variables`: loads conversation history and entities from memory
- `save_context`: saves context from the conversation to memory
- `clear`: clears memory contents

`PromptTemplate` has the following templates:
- `ENTITY_MEMORY_CONVERSATION_TEMPLATE`: a template for entity memory conversation
- `SUMMARY_PROMPT`: a template for summarizing conversation
- `DEFAULT_ENTITY_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE`: a template for extracting entities from conversation

## Inputs and Outputs
The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.

The code also defines default templates for entity memory conversation, summarization, and entity extraction.

The code defines several classes and templates for language modeling and conversation management. The `ConversationEntityMemory` class is used for extracting and summarizing entities in a conversation and storing them in memory. The `PromptTemplate` class is used for defining templates for entity memory conversation, summarization, and entity extraction. The `LLMChain` class is used for language modeling. 

The `ConversationEntityMemory` class has methods for loading, saving, and clearing conversation history and entities. The `PromptTemplate` class has templates for entity memory conversation, summarization, and entity extraction. The `ENTITY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` template is used for extracting entities from a conversation, while the `ENTITY_SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT` template is used for summarizing information about entities in a conversation. 

The inputs and outputs for each method and template are described in the code. Overall, the code provides a framework for managing and summarizing conversations between humans and AI assistants.

The code provides a framework for managing and summarizing conversations between humans and AI assistants. It defines several classes, including `ConversationEntityMemory` for extracting and summarizing entities in a conversation, `PromptTemplate` for defining templates for entity memory conversation, summarization, and entity extraction, and `LLMChain` for language modeling. The code also includes templates for extracting knowledge triples from conversations and summarizing information about entities. The inputs and outputs for each method and template are described in the code.
