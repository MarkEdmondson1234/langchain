This code defines a class `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` that is a subclass of `BaseChatMemory` and `SummarizerMixin`. The class includes four attributes: `max_token_limit`, `moving_summary_buffer`, `memory_key`, and `buffer`, and four methods: `load_memory_variables`, `memory_variables`, `save_context`, and `clear`. The purpose of this class is to store conversation memory in a buffer and summarize it. The `buffer` method returns a list of `BaseMessage` objects that represent the conversation history. The `memory_variables` method returns a list of memory variables. The `load_memory_variables` method returns the conversation history buffer. The `save_context` method saves the input and output to the conversation history buffer, and the `prune` method prunes the buffer if it exceeds the max token limit. The `clear` method clears the conversation history. The input and output types for each method are described in the code.
