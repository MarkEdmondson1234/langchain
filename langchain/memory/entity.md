This code defines two classes, `BaseEntityStore` and `InMemoryEntityStore`, both of which are used for storing and managing entities. `BaseEntityStore` is an abstract base class that defines methods for getting, setting, deleting, checking existence, and clearing entities. `InMemoryEntityStore` is a subclass of `BaseEntityStore` and implements these methods using an in-memory dictionary. The input and output types for each method are described in the code.

This code defines a class `RedisEntityStore` that is used for storing and managing entities using Redis as a backend. The class has methods for getting, setting, deleting, checking existence, and clearing entities. Entities have a default TTL of 1 day, and the TTL is extended by 3 days every time the entity is read back. The input and output types for each method are described in the code.

This code defines a class `ConversationEntityMemory` that is used for extracting and summarizing entities in a conversation and storing them in memory. The class has methods for loading, saving, and clearing conversation history and entities. The input and output types for each method are described in the code. The class uses `LLMChain` and `BasePromptTemplate` for entity extraction and summarization. The class also uses a `BaseEntityStore` for storing and managing entities, with `InMemoryEntityStore` and `RedisEntityStore` as possible implementations.
