This code defines a class `BaseChatMemory` that is a subclass of `BaseMemory` and `ABC`. The class includes three attributes: `chat_memory`, `output_key`, and `input_key`, and three methods: `_get_input_output`, `save_context`, and `clear`. The purpose of this class is to save the context of a conversation to a buffer and clear the memory contents. The `chat_memory` attribute is a `BaseChatMessageHistory` object that is used to store the conversation history. The `_get_input_output` method gets the input and output from a conversation and returns them as a tuple. The `save_context` method saves the input and output to the conversation history buffer, and the `clear` method clears the conversation history. The input and output types for each method are described in the code.
