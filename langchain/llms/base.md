This code provides a base interface for large language models to expose. It includes several classes and functions for managing callbacks, updating caches, and getting prompts. The code uses several external libraries such as pydantic and yaml. The code also imports modules from langchain, including the base_language module and the callbacks module. The get_prompts function retrieves prompts that are already cached, while the update_cache function updates the cache and gets the LLM output. If the code does not know the answer to a question, it will truthfully say it does not know.

This code provides a method called generate that runs a large language model on given prompts and inputs. It checks if the input prompts are a list of strings and raises an error if they are not. It also manages caching and callbacks using the CallbackManager class. The generate method returns an LLMResult object containing the generated text and any relevant output.

This code provides a method called agenerate that runs a large language model on given prompts and inputs. It manages caching and callbacks using the AsyncCallbackManager class. The agenerate method returns an LLMResult object containing the generated text and any relevant output. The code also includes several other methods such as __call__, _identifying_params, dict, and save, which are used for managing and saving the LLM.

The save method saves the LLM to a file specified by the file_path argument, either in JSON or YAML format.

The save method saves the LLM to a file specified by the file_path argument, either in JSON or YAML format. The LLM class is an abstract class that expects subclasses to implement a simpler call method. The purpose of this class is to expose a simpler interface for working with LLMs, rather than expect the user to implement the full _generate method. The LLM class includes several methods such as _call, _acall, _generate, and _agenerate, which are used for running the LLM on given prompts and inputs.
