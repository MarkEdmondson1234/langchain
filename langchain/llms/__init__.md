The code you provided is a module that contains wrappers for various large language models APIs. It imports several classes from different modules, such as `GooseAI` from `langchain.llms.gooseai` and `HuggingFaceEndpoint` from `langchain.llms.huggingface_endpoint`. The module also defines a dictionary called `type_to_cls_dict` that maps string keys to corresponding classes. However, the code does not include any examples of how to use these classes or functions.
