The code you provided defines a class called `FakeListLLM` that serves as a fake wrapper for testing purposes. The class has a `_llm_type` property for returning the type of LLM and a `_call` method for returning a response based on a given prompt. The class also has a `_identifying_params` property for returning identifying parameters. The code imports several modules and defines a `CallbackManagerForLLMRun` class for managing callbacks during LLM runs, and a `LLM` class that serves as the base class for all LLMs.
