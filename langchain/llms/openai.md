The code you provided defines a module that wraps around OpenAI APIs. It includes several utility functions and a few classes, including a base class called `BaseLLM` and two callback manager classes called `CallbackManagerForLLMRun` and `AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun`. The module also includes a function called `completion_with_retry` that uses the Tenacity library to retry OpenAI API calls, and an async version of this function called `acompletion_with_retry`.

The code you provided defines a class called `BaseOpenAI` that is a wrapper around OpenAI large language models. The class includes many parameters that control how the model generates text, such as the temperature and maximum number of tokens to generate. The class also includes a root validator that builds extra keyword arguments from additional parameters that were passed in. If the model name starts with "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4", the class returns an instance of the `OpenAIChat` class instead.

If the model name starts with "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4", the class returns an instance of the `OpenAIChat` class instead. The `generate` method is used to call out to OpenAI's endpoint to generate text based on the given prompts. The `_agenerate` method is an asynchronous version of `generate`. Both methods take in a list of prompts and an optional list of stop words, and return an `LLMResult` object containing the generated text and information about the token usage. The code also includes some helper functions for handling responses and retrying failed requests.

The code also includes some helper functions for handling responses and retrying failed requests. The `get_sub_prompts` method is used to get the sub prompts for an LLM call, the `create_llm_result` method is used to create an `LLMResult` object from the choices and prompts, the `stream` method is used to call OpenAI with streaming flag and return the resulting generator, and the `prep_streaming_params` method is used to prepare the params for streaming. The `_invocation_params`, `_identifying_params`, and `_llm_type` methods are used to get the parameters used to invoke the model, the identifying parameters, and the type of LLM, respectively.

The code you provided defines three methods in a class called `BaseOpenAI`. The `_llm_type` method returns the type of the large language model as a string. The `get_num_tokens` method calculates the number of tokens in a given text using the `tiktoken` package. The `modelname_to_contextsize` method calculates the maximum number of tokens possible to generate for a given model name, and the `max_tokens_for_prompt` method calculates the maximum number of tokens possible to generate for a given prompt. All methods take in inputs and return outputs as specified in their respective docstrings.

The code you provided defines two classes, `OpenAI` and `AzureOpenAI`, which are wrappers around OpenAI large language models. Both classes require the `openai` python package to be installed and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set with your API key. The `OpenAI` class includes a `_invocation_params` method that returns a dictionary of parameters used to invoke the model, and a `_llm_type` method that returns the type of the large language model as a string. The `AzureOpenAI` class includes additional parameters specific to Azure, such as `deployment_name`, and includes an additional `_identifying_params` method that returns a mapping of identifying parameters. Both classes can take in any parameters that are valid to be passed to the `openai.create` call.

The code you provided defines a class called `OpenAIChat`, which is a wrapper around OpenAI Chat large language models. The class requires the `openai` python package to be installed and the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set with your API key. The class includes various parameters such as `model_name`, `model_kwargs`, `max_retries`, `prefix_messages`, `streaming`, `allowed_special`, and `disallowed_special`. The class also includes several methods such as `_default_params`, `build_extra`, and `validate_environment`, which are used to build and validate additional parameters passed to the model. An example of how to use the class is provided in the docstring.

The `get_num_tokens` method calculates the number of tokens in a given text using the `tiktoken` package. If the python version is less than 3.8, it calls the `get_num_tokens` method of its superclass. Otherwise, it tries to import the `tiktoken` package and creates a GPT-3.5-Turbo encoder instance to encode the text and calculate the number of tokens.
