The code you provided defines a class called `PredictionGuard`, which is a wrapper around Prediction Guard large language models. The class includes various parameters such as `client`, `name`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `token`, and `stop`. The class is used to call out to Prediction Guard's model proxy and generate text. The code also imports various modules such as `logging`, `pydantic`, `CallbackManagerForLLMRun`, `enforce_stop_tokens`, `get_from_dict_or_env`, and `LLM`.

The code you provided defines a class called `Cohere`, which is a wrapper around Cohere large language models. The class includes various parameters such as `client`, `model`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `k`, `p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `truncate`, `cohere_api_key`, and `stop`. The class is used to call out to Cohere's generate endpoint and generate text. The code also imports various modules such as `logging`, `pydantic`, `CallbackManagerForLLMRun`, `enforce_stop_tokens`, `get_from_dict_or_env`, and `LLM`.
