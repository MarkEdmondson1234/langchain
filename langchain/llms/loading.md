The code you provided defines a method called `load_llm` that loads a large language model from either a JSON or YAML file. The method first converts the file to a `Path` object, then loads the configuration from the file using either `json.load` or `yaml.safe_load`. The configuration is then used to create an instance of the appropriate LLM class using the `load_llm_from_config` method.
