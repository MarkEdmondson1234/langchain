The code you provided defines a wrapper for HazyResearch's Manifest library. The `ManifestWrapper` class is a subclass of the `LLM` base class and serves as a wrapper around the `Manifest` library. The code imports several modules, including `CallbackManagerForLLMRun` and `LLM`. The `ManifestWrapper` class has a `client` attribute for storing the `Manifest` client, a `llm_kwargs` attribute for storing keyword arguments to pass to the LLM, and a `Config` class for configuring Pydantic objects. The class also has a `_identifying_params` property for getting the identifying parameters and a `_llm_type` property for getting the type of LLM. The class has a `_call` method for calling out to the LLM through Manifest, which takes a prompt, stop tokens, and a callback manager as input and returns a generated text.
