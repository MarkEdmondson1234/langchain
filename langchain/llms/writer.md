The code you provided does not define any classes or methods related to a "Writer API". It only imports some modules and defines some utility functions.

The code you provided defines a class called `Writer`, which is a wrapper around Writer large language models. The class includes various parameters such as `model_id`, `tokens_to_generate`, `logprobs`, `temperature`, `length`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `repetition_penalty`, `random_seed`, `beam_search_diversity_rate`, `beam_width`, `length_pentaly`, `writer_api_key`, `stop`, and `base_url`. The class also includes methods such as `_call`, `_default_params`, `_identifying_params`, and `_llm_type`, and is used to call out to Writer's complete endpoint. The code is used for text-generation and text2text-generation.
