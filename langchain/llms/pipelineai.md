The code you provided defines a module that includes a class called `SelfHostedPipeline` for running model inference on self-hosted remote hardware. The module also imports several libraries, including `pydantic` and `logging`, and includes several utility functions for working with language models. However, the code you provided does not include any examples of how to use the `SelfHostedPipeline` class or any other functions in the module.

The code you provided defines a module that includes a class called `PipelineAI` for working with large language models using the PipelineAI API. The class includes several methods, such as `_call`, `_identifying_params`, and `_llm_type`, which are used to call the PipelineAI endpoint and get identifying parameters. The class also includes a method called `validate_environment` that checks that the PipelineAI API key and python package are installed and a method called `build_extra` that builds extra keyword arguments from additional parameters that were passed in. The code includes an example of how to use the `PipelineAI` class.
