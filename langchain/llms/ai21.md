The code you provided defines a class called `AI21PenaltyData`, which is a wrapper around AI21 penalty data. The class includes various parameters such as `scale`, `applyToWhitespaces`, `applyToPunctuations`, `applyToNumbers`, `applyToStopwords`, and `applyToEmojis`. The code is used for text-generation and text2text-generation. The class is a subclass of `BaseModel` from the `pydantic` module, and includes a root validator method. The code also imports various modules such as `requests` and `CallbackManagerForLLMRun`.

The code you provided defines a class called `AI21`, which is a wrapper around AI21 large language models. The class includes various parameters such as `model`, `temperature`, `maxTokens`, `minTokens`, `topP`, `presencePenalty`, `countPenalty`, `frequencyPenalty`, `numResults`, `logitBias`, `ai21_api_key`, `stop`, and `base_url`. The class is used to call out to AI21's complete endpoint for text-generation and text2text-generation. To use this code, you should have the environment variable `AI21_API_KEY` set with your API key. The code is a subclass of `LLM` and includes various methods such as `_default_params`, `_identifying_params`, and `_call`. The code also imports various modules such as `requests` and `CallbackManagerForLLMRun`.
