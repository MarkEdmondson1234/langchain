The code you provided defines a class called `_AnthropicCommon`, which is a wrapper around Anthropic APIs. The class includes various parameters such as `model`, `max_tokens_to_sample`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `streaming`, `default_request_timeout`, `anthropic_api_key`, `HUMAN_PROMPT`, `AI_PROMPT`, and `count_tokens`. The class also includes methods such as `validate_environment`, `_default_params`, `_identifying_params`, `_get_anthropic_stop`, and `get_num_tokens`. The class is used to interact with the Anthropic Completion API.

The class is used to interact with the Anthropic Completion API. Additionally, the code defines a class called `Anthropic`, which is a wrapper around Anthropic's large language models. The class includes methods such as `_wrap_prompt` and `_call`, and is used to call out to Anthropic's completion endpoint. The class is deprecated and should be replaced with `ChatAnthropic`.

The code you provided includes two classes. The first class is called `_AnthropicCommon`, which is a wrapper around Anthropic APIs. The class includes various parameters such as `model`, `max_tokens_to_sample`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `streaming`, `default_request_timeout`, `anthropic_api_key`, `HUMAN_PROMPT`, `AI_PROMPT`, and `count_tokens`. The class also includes methods such as `validate_environment`, `_default_params`, `_identifying_params`, `_get_anthropic_stop`, and `get_num_tokens`. The class is used to interact with the Anthropic Completion API. 

The second class is called `Anthropic`, which is a wrapper around Anthropic's large language models. The class includes methods such as `_wrap_prompt` and `_call`, and is used to call out to Anthropic's completion endpoint. The class is deprecated and should be replaced with `ChatAnthropic`. 

The code also includes two methods called `_acall` and `stream` which are used to call Anthropic's completion endpoint asynchronously and return a generator representing the stream of tokens from Anthropic, respectively.
