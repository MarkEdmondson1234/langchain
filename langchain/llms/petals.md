The code you provided defines a module that includes a class called `PetalsAPI` for working with language models using the Petals API. The class includes several methods, such as `_call`, `_identifying_params`, and `_llm_type`, which are used to call the Petals endpoint and get identifying parameters. The code uses the `pydantic` library for data validation and imports several libraries, including `logging` and `CallbackManagerForLLMRun`. However, the code you provided does not include any examples of how to use the `PetalsAPI` class or any other functions in the module.
