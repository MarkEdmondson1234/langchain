The code you provided defines a class called `StochasticAI`, which is a wrapper around StochasticAI large language models. The class requires the `stochasticai` python package to be installed and the `STOCHASTIC_API_KEY` environment variable to be set with your API key. The class includes various parameters such as `model_name`, `model_kwargs`, `max_retries`, `prefix_messages`, `streaming`, `allowed_special`, and `disallowed_special`. The class also includes several methods such as `_default_params`, `build_extra`, and `validate_environment`, which are used to build and validate additional parameters passed to the model.

The `_call` method of the `StochasticAI` class makes a call to the StochasticAI endpoint using the `model_api_request` method from the `stochasticai` package.
