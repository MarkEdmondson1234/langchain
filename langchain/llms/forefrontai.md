The code you provided defines a class called `ForefrontAI` that wraps around the ForefrontAI large language models API. The class includes several parameters, such as `temperature`, `length`, `top_p`, and `top_k`, that can be used to tune the generation of tokens. The class also includes a flag called `repetition_penalty` that determines how the generation of tokens is penalized. The code includes a method called `_call` that takes in a prompt and an optional list of stop words and returns the string generated by the model. An example of how to use the `ForefrontAI` class is provided in the code.
