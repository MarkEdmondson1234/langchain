The code you provided defines a wrapper for HuggingFace Pipeline APIs. The code imports several modules and defines a `CallbackManagerForLLMRun` class for managing callbacks during LLM runs, and a `LLM` class that serves as the base class for all LLMs. The code also defines a `enforce_stop_tokens` function for enforcing stop tokens during text generation. The code sets several default values for model ID and task, and defines a `VALID_TASKS` tuple for valid task types. Finally, the code defines a logger for logging messages.

The code sets several default values for model ID and task, and defines a `VALID_TASKS` tuple for valid task types. Finally, the code defines a logger for logging messages. The `HuggingFacePipeline` class is a wrapper around the HuggingFace Pipeline API and supports `text-generation` and `text2text-generation` tasks. It has a `from_model_id` class method for constructing the pipeline object from a given model ID and task, and a `pipeline` attribute for storing the pipeline object. The class also has a `model_id` attribute for storing the model ID, a `model_kwargs` attribute for storing keyword arguments to pass to the model, and a `Config` class for configuring Pydantic objects. The `from_model_id` method takes a model ID, task, device, and model_kwargs as input and returns an LLM object.
