The code you provided defines two functions for running model inference on self-hosted remote hardware. The `_generate_text` function accepts a pipeline callable and returns text predictions for each document in the batch. The `_send_pipeline_to_device` function sends a pipeline to a device on the cluster. The code imports several modules and uses the `pydantic` library for data validation.

The code you provided defines a class called `SelfHostedPipeline` that runs model inference on self-hosted remote hardware. The class takes several parameters, including a function to load the model remotely, an inference function to send to the remote hardware, and a list of requirements to install on the hardware to inference the model. The class also includes several examples of how to use it with different types of models and hardware configurations. The code uses the `pydantic` library for data validation.

The code you provided defines a class called `SelfHostedPipeline` that allows for running model inference on self-hosted remote hardware. The class includes several methods, such as `_call`, `_identifying_params`, and `_llm_type`, which are used to send the inference function to the remote hardware and get identifying parameters. The class also includes a method called `from_pipeline` that initializes the `SelfHostedPipeline` from a pipeline object or string. The code uses the `pydantic` library for data validation and imports the `runhouse` python package for running the model on remote hardware.
