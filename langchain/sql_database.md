The code you provided is a SQLAlchemy wrapper around a database. It imports various modules and classes from the SQLAlchemy package, including MetaData, Table, create_engine, inspect, select, text, CursorResult, Engine, ProgrammingError, SQLAlchemyError, and CreateTable. The code defines one function, _format_index, which takes a ReflectedIndex object as input and returns a formatted string. The code does not define any classes or methods.

The code you provided is a SQLAlchemy wrapper around a database. It defines a class called SQLDatabase that takes in various parameters, including engine, schema, metadata, ignore_tables, include_tables, sample_rows_in_table_info, indexes_in_table_info, custom_table_info, and view_support. The class has three methods: __init__, from_uri, dialect, and get_usable_table_names. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The code also defines a property called dialect and a function called get_usable_table_names. The from_uri function constructs a SQLAlchemy engine from URI.

The code you provided defines several functions related to getting information about tables in a database. The functions include get_table_names, table_info, get_table_info, _get_table_indexes, _get_sample_rows, and run. The functions are related in that they all involve retrieving information about tables in a database, with get_table_names and get_table_info providing general information about tables and _get_table_indexes and _get_sample_rows providing more specific information about table indexes and sample rows, respectively. The run function is used to execute a SQL command and return the results. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

# Summary
The code defines three functions related to executing SQL commands and retrieving information about tables in a database. The functions are run, get_table_info_no_throw, and run_no_throw. The run function executes a SQL command and returns a string representing the results. The get_table_info_no_throw function retrieves information about specified tables, and the run_no_throw function executes a SQL command and returns a string representing the results, with the added functionality of handling errors.

## Functions
- run: Executes a SQL command and returns a string representing the results. Inputs are the SQL command and a fetch parameter, which can be "all" or "one". Outputs are a string representing the results of the SQL command.
- get_table_info_no_throw: Retrieves information about specified tables. Inputs are a list of table names. Outputs are a string representing the information about the specified tables.
- run_no_throw: Executes a SQL command and returns a string representing the results, with the added functionality of handling errors. Inputs are the SQL command and a fetch parameter, which can be "all" or "one". Outputs are a string representing the results of the SQL command, or an error message if an error occurs.
