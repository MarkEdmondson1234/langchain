The code defines functions for initializing a VectorStore from texts or documents and embeddings, and for searching for documents most similar to a given embedding vector. The `similarity_search_by_vector` function takes in an embedding vector, k (number of documents to return), and filter (optional metadata filter), and returns a list of Documents most similar to the query vector. The `from_texts` and `from_documents` functions initialize a VectorStore from a list of texts or documents and embeddings. The `get_connection_string` function retrieves the Postgres connection string from the environment or input parameters. The `connection_string_from_db_params` function constructs the connection string from database parameters.
