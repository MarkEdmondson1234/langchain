This code defines an interface for vector stores. The code includes several classes and functions such as `BaseModel`, `BaseRetriever`, and `Document`. The `Embeddings` class is used to represent embedding functions. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

This code defines an interface for vector stores, including functions such as `add_texts`, `aadd_texts`, `add_documents`, `aadd_documents`, `search`, `asearch`, `similarity_search`, and `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`. The `Document` class is used to represent documents, and the `Embeddings` class is used to represent embedding functions. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

This code defines an interface for vector stores, including functions such as `add_texts`, `aadd_texts`, `add_documents`, `aadd_documents`, `search`, `asearch`, `similarity_search`, and `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`. The `Document` class is used to represent documents, and the `Embeddings` class is used to represent embedding functions. The functions are related to each other in that they all involve manipulating and searching through vectors and documents. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The code you provided specifically includes functions for performing similarity searches and selecting documents based on maximal marginal relevance. The inputs and outputs for these functions are also described in the code you provided.
