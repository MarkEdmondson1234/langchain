This code defines a wrapper around Atlas by Nomic, which is a neural database and rhizomatic instrument. The main function is `AtlasDB`, which initializes the Atlas client and creates a new project if it doesn't already exist. The `add_texts` function can be used to add new texts to the vectorstore, and it takes in texts, metadatas, ids, and refresh as inputs. The `texts` input is an iterable of strings to add to the vectorstore, `metadatas` is an optional list of dictionaries, `ids` is an optional list of IDs, and `refresh` is a boolean indicating whether or not to refresh indices with the updated data. The function returns a list of IDs of the added texts. Additionally, there are functions for creating an index in the project, running similarity search with AtlasDB, and creating an AtlasDB vectorstore from a list of texts. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The code also includes a function for converting search results into a list of documents with scores.

This code defines a wrapper around ChromaDB, which is an embeddings platform. The main function is `Chroma`, which initializes the Chroma client and creates a new collection if it doesn't already exist. The `add_texts` function can be used to add new texts to the vectorstore, and it takes in texts, metadatas, ids, and kwargs as inputs. The `texts` input is an iterable of strings to add to the vectorstore, `metadatas` is an optional list of dictionaries, `ids` is an optional list of IDs, and `kwargs` is a dictionary of additional arguments. The function returns a list of IDs of the added texts. Additionally, there is a function for querying the collection, which takes in query texts or embeddings, the number of results to return, and additional arguments. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

As for the functions you asked me to summarize, they are part of the Chroma class and are used to create a Chroma vectorstore from a list of documents or raw texts. The `from_texts` function creates a Chroma vectorstore from a list of raw texts, while the `from_documents` function creates a Chroma vectorstore from a list of documents. Both functions take in various optional arguments, such as an embedding function, a list of metadatas, and a list of document IDs. The `update_document` function updates a document in the collection by taking in a document ID and a document object. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.
