This code is not related to the previous conversation. It defines a wrapper around the Annoy vector database. The code includes a function for importing the Annoy package, and constants for index metrics and default metric. The code also imports various modules and defines several classes and functions, including a base class for vector stores, a class for in-memory document storage, and a function for computing maximal marginal relevance. However, there are no inputs or outputs described for any of the functions or classes.

This code defines a wrapper around the Annoy vector database, which includes several methods for searching and retrieving documents based on a query. The `Annoy` class includes an `__init__` method for initializing the necessary components, an `add_texts` method for adding new texts to the index (although this is not supported by Annoy), a `process_index_results` method for turning Annoy results into a list of documents and scores, and several methods for performing similarity searches with scores based on either a vector or an index. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The `max_marginal_relevance_search` function takes a query string and returns a list of documents selected using the maximal marginal relevance algorithm, which optimizes for similarity to the query and diversity among selected documents. The `__from` method constructs an Annoy wrapper from raw documents, embedding them, creating an in-memory docstore, and initializing the Annoy database. The `from_texts` method is a user-friendly interface that embeds documents, creates an in-memory docstore, and initializes the Annoy database.

The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The `from_embeddings` method constructs an Annoy wrapper from embeddings, creating an in-memory docstore with provided embeddings and initializing the Annoy database. The `save_local` method saves the Annoy index, docstore, and index_to_docstore_id to disk, while the `load_local` method loads them from disk.
