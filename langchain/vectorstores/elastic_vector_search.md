This code defines an interface for a vector store that can be used to manipulate and search through vectors and documents. The `Document` class is used to represent documents, and the `Embeddings` class is used to represent embedding functions. The code includes functions for performing similarity searches and selecting documents based on maximal marginal relevance. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The code you provided specifically defines a concrete implementation of the abstract base class `VectorStore` called `ElasticVectorSearch`, which is a wrapper around an Elasticsearch vector database. The `ElasticVectorSearch` class includes methods for adding documents to the vector store and retrieving relevant documents based on a query. The inputs and outputs for each of these methods are also described in the code.

The `ElasticVectorSearch` class includes methods for adding documents to the vector store and retrieving relevant documents based on a query. The `add_texts` method runs more texts through the embeddings and adds them to the vector store. The `add_texts` method takes in an iterable of texts, an optional list of metadata dictionaries, and a boolean for refreshing indices. The output is a list of strings representing the document IDs that were added to the vector store.

The `similarity_search` method returns a list of documents most similar to a given query, while the `similarity_search_with_score` method returns a list of documents most similar to a given query along with their similarity scores. The `from_texts` method constructs an `ElasticVectorSearch` wrapper from raw documents, embedding them, creating a new index for the embeddings in the Elasticsearch instance, and adding the documents to the newly created Elasticsearch index.
