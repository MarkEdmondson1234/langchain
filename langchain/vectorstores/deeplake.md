The code is a wrapper around Activeloop Deep Lake. It defines a `VectorStore` class that includes a `vector_search` function for naive search for nearest neighbors and a `dp_filter` function as a filter helper function for Deep Lake. The `vector_search` function takes in a query embedding and data vectors and returns a list of indices of nearest neighbors and their distances. The `dp_filter` function takes in a dictionary and a filter and returns a boolean indicating whether the dictionary meets the filter requirements. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

The code is a wrapper around Activeloop Deep Lake, a data lake for deep learning applications. It includes a `VectorStore` class that implements naive similarity search and filtering for fast prototyping, and can be extended with Tensor Query Language (TQL) for production use cases over billion rows. The `DeepLake` class takes in several arguments such as `dataset_path`, `token`, `embedding_function`, `read_only`, `ingestion_batch_size`, `num_workers`, `verbose`, and `**kwargs`. It initializes with a Deep Lake client and loads or creates a Deep Lake dataset. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

## functions
The code defines a `VectorStore` class that includes a `vector_search` function for naive search for nearest neighbors and a `dp_filter` function as a filter helper function for Deep Lake. The `DeepLake` class takes in several arguments such as `dataset_path`, `token`, `embedding_function`, `read_only`, `ingestion_batch_size`, `num_workers`, `verbose`, and `**kwargs`. It initializes with a Deep Lake client and loads or creates a Deep Lake dataset. The `add_texts` function runs more texts through the embeddings and adds them to the vectorstore.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
The `add_texts` function takes in `texts` (Iterable[str]), `metadatas` (Optional[List[dict]], optional), `ids` (Optional[List[str]], optional), and `**kwargs` (Any). It returns a list of IDs of the added texts.

The `VectorStore` class includes a `vector_search` function that takes in a query embedding and data vectors and returns a list of indices of nearest neighbors and their distances. The `dp_filter` function takes in a dictionary and a filter and returns a boolean indicating whether the dictionary meets the filter requirements.

The `DeepLake` class takes in `dataset_path` (str), `token` (Optional[str]), `embedding_function` (Optional[Embeddings]), `read_only` (Optional[bool]), `ingestion_batch_size` (int), `num_workers` (int), `verbose` (bool), and `**kwargs` (Any). It initializes with a Deep Lake client and loads or creates a Deep Lake dataset. It returns None.

The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

This code defines a `_search_helper` function that returns documents most similar to a query. It includes an optional embedding function, distance metric, filter, and maximal marginal relevance. It also defines a `similarity_search` function that uses the `_search_helper` function to return the most similar documents to a query.

## functions
The `_search_helper` function is used by the `similarity_search` function to find the most similar documents to a query. 

# Inputs and outputs for each function
The `_search_helper` function takes in `query` (Any[str, None]), `embedding` (Any[float, None]), `k` (int), `distance_metric` (str), `use_maximal_marginal_relevance` (Optional[bool]), `fetch_k` (Optional[int]), `filter` (Optional[Any[Dict[str, str], Callable, str]]), `return_score` (Optional[bool]), and `**kwargs` (Any). It returns a list of Documents selected by the specified distance metric, or if `return_score` is True, a tuple of (Document, score).

The `similarity_search` function takes in `query` (str) and `k` (int). It returns a list of Documents selected by the specified distance metric.

This code defines a `max_marginal_relevance_search_by_vector` function and a `max_marginal_relevance_search` function that both return documents selected using the maximal marginal relevance. The `max_marginal_relevance_search_by_vector` function takes in an embedding (a list of floats), k (an integer), fetch_k (an integer), lambda_mult (a float between 0 and 1), and **kwargs (any additional keyword arguments). It returns a list of Documents selected by maximal marginal relevance. The `max_marginal_relevance_search` function takes in a query (a string), k (an integer), fetch_k (an integer), lambda_mult (a float between 0 and 1), and **kwargs (any additional keyword arguments). It returns a list of Documents selected by maximal marginal relevance. The `from_texts` class method can also be used to create a Deep Lake dataset from a list of texts.

This code defines several functions related to searching for documents based on similarity to a query. Specifically, it includes a `_search_helper` function that is used by the `similarity_search` function to find the most similar documents to a query. It also includes a `max_marginal_relevance_search_by_vector` function and a `max_marginal_relevance_search` function that both return documents selected using the maximal marginal relevance. The `from_texts` class method can also be used to create a Deep Lake dataset from a list of texts. Additionally, the code includes functions for deleting and persisting datasets. The `delete` function can be used to delete specific documents or the entire dataset, while the `force_delete_by_path` function can be used to force delete a dataset by path. Finally, the `persist` function can be used to persist the dataset.
