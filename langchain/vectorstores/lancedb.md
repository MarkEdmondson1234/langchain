The code defines a wrapper around LanceDB vector database. It imports necessary modules and defines a `VectorStore` class that includes an `__init__` function and several helper functions such as `add_documents`, `get_relevant_documents`, `maximal_marginal_relevance`, `similarity_search_with_score`, and `_similarity_search_with_relevance_scores`. It also includes a `from_texts` class method that constructs a Weaviate wrapper from raw documents. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

The code defines a wrapper around LanceDB vector database. It includes a `VectorStore` class that has several functions such as `add_texts` and `similarity_search`. The `add_texts` function turns texts into embedding and adds it to the database. The `similarity_search` function returns documents most similar to the query. The `from_texts` class method constructs a LanceDB wrapper from raw documents. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.
