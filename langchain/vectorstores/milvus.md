This code defines a class called `VectorStoreWrapper` which provides a wrapper around the Milvus vector database. The class includes several methods such as `add_document`, `delete_document`, `search`, `search_by_id`, `update_document`, and `get_document_by_id`. The `add_document` method adds a document to the vector store. The `delete_document` method deletes a document from the vector store. The `search` method searches for documents in the vector store based on a query vector. The `search_by_id` method searches for a specific document in the vector store based on its ID. The `update_document` method updates a document in the vector store. The `get_document_by_id` method retrieves a document from the vector store based on its ID. The class uses the Pydantic library to define data models for the Milvus API.

The code you provided is a part of this class and defines some default search parameters and a method `_create_connection_alias` which creates a connection to the Milvus server.

As for the specific code you provided, it generates a new connection to the Milvus server if one does not already exist. The `_init` method initializes the vector store by creating a collection, extracting fields, creating an index, creating search parameters, and loading data. The `_create_collection` method creates a collection with the specified embeddings and metadata. The `_extract_fields` method grabs the existing fields from the collection. The `_get_index` method returns the vector index information if it exists.

The class uses the Pydantic library to define data models for the Milvus API. 

As for the specific code you provided, it creates an index on the collection if one does not already exist. The `_create_index` method creates an index on the vector field of the collection using the specified index parameters. If the default index parameters do not work, it tries to create an index using the AUTOINDEX based index. The `_create_search_params` method generates search parameters based on the current index type. The `_load` method loads the collection if it is available. The `add_texts` method inserts text data into Milvus. It assumes that the texts all fit in memory and that metadata keys will need to be present for all inserted values. It raises a `MilvusException` if there is a failure to add texts.
