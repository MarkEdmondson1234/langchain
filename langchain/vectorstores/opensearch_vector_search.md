This code defines a class called `Pinecone` which provides a wrapper around the Pinecone vector database. The class includes two methods: `add_texts` and `similarity_search_with_score`. The `add_texts` method adds documents to the vector store and returns a list of ids. The `similarity_search_with_score` method performs a similarity search with Pinecone and returns a list of tuples, each containing a document and its similarity score. The class also includes an `__init__` method which initializes the schema and creates a connection to Pinecone, and several optional arguments. The `__init__` method also checks if the Pinecone client is installed and if the index is an instance of `pinecone.index.Index`. Additionally, the code includes a method called `from_texts` which constructs a Pinecone wrapper from raw documents by embedding them and adding them to a provided Pinecone index. Finally, the code includes a method called `from_existing_index` which loads a Pinecone vectorstore from an index name. The `for` loop in the `add_texts` method iterates over batches of texts, creates embeddings for each batch, and upserts them to Pinecone. The `from_existing_index` method loads a Pinecone vectorstore from an index name.

This code defines several functions related to approximate k-NN search and script scoring search in OpenSearch. The `_default_text_mapping` function creates a default mapping to create an index for approximate k-NN search. The `_default_approximate_search_query` function creates a default query for approximate k-NN search. The `_approximate_search_query_with_boolean_filter` and `_approximate_search_query_with_lucene_filter` functions create queries for approximate k-NN search with boolean and Lucene filters, respectively. The `_default_script_query` function creates a default query for script scoring search. The `__get_painless_scripting_source` function returns the script source for Painless Scripting based on the space type.

This code defines two functions related to Painless Scripting Search in OpenSearch. The `_default_painless_scripting_query` function creates a default query for Painless Scripting Search. The `_get_kwargs_value` function gets the value of a key if present in a dictionary, else it returns the default value.

This code defines a class called OpenSearchVectorSearch, which is a wrapper around OpenSearch as a vector database. It has two functions: add_texts and similarity_search. The add_texts function runs more texts through the embeddings and adds them to the vectorstore. The similarity_search function returns documents most similar to the query. It supports Approximate Search, Script Scoring, and Painless Scripting.

This code defines a function called similarity_search within a class called OpenSearchVectorSearch. The function returns documents most similar to a query and supports Approximate Search, Script Scoring, and Painless Scripting. The function takes in various optional arguments depending on the search type, such as space_type and pre_filter. The function also takes in text_field, metadata_field, and vector_field as optional arguments. The function returns a list of Documents, which have page_content and metadata attributes.

This code defines a class called OpenSearchVectorSearch, which is a wrapper around OpenSearch as a vector database. It has two functions: add_texts and similarity_search. The add_texts function runs more texts through the embeddings and adds them to the vectorstore. The similarity_search function returns documents most similar to the query. It supports Approximate Search, Script Scoring, and Painless Scripting. 

The function from_texts is a classmethod that constructs an OpenSearchVectorSearch wrapper from raw documents. It takes in a list of texts, an embedding object, and optional metadata. It also takes in various optional arguments depending on the search type, such as space_type and pre_filter. The function returns an OpenSearchVectorSearch object. 

The add_texts function takes in a list of texts and adds them to the vectorstore. It returns nothing. 

The similarity_search function takes in a query and optional arguments depending on the search type. It returns a list of Documents, which have page_content and metadata attributes. 

The functions are related in that they all deal with searching and adding documents to the vectorstore.
