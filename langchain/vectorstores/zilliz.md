This code defines several classes and functions for interacting with Tair Vector, a vectorstore platform. The `Tair` class is a wrapper around Tair Vector and includes functions such as `from_texts`, `from_documents`, `drop_index`, and `from_existing_index`. The `Document` and `Embeddings` classes are used to represent documents and embedding functions, respectively. The `get_from_dict_or_env` function is used to retrieve values from a dictionary or environment variables. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

This code defines a class `Zilliz` which is a wrapper around Milvus, a vectorstore platform. The class includes a function `_create_index` which creates an index on the collection. The `from_texts` function creates a new Zilliz instance from a list of texts and indexes it with HNSW. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code. The `Embeddings` and `Milvus` classes are used to represent embedding functions and Milvus connections, respectively.
