This code defines a wrapper around Atlas by Nomic. It includes several functions related to searching for documents based on similarity to a query, including a `_search_helper` function that is used by the `similarity_search` function to find the most similar documents to a query. It also includes a `max_marginal_relevance_search_by_vector` function and a `max_marginal_relevance_search` function that both return documents selected using the maximal marginal relevance. The `from_texts` class method can also be used to create a Deep Lake dataset from a list of texts. Additionally, the code includes functions for deleting and persisting datasets. The `delete` function can be used to delete specific documents or the entire dataset, while the `force_delete_by_path` function can be used to force delete a dataset by path. Finally, the `persist` function can be used to persist the dataset. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

This code defines a wrapper around Atlas by Nomic, which is a neural database and rhizomatic instrument. The main function is `AtlasDB`, which initializes the Atlas client and creates a new project if it doesn't already exist. The `add_texts` function can be used to add new texts to the vectorstore, and it takes in texts, metadatas, ids, and refresh as inputs. The `texts` input is an iterable of strings to add to the vectorstore, `metadatas` is an optional list of dictionaries, `ids` is an optional list of IDs, and `refresh` is a boolean indicating whether or not to refresh indices with the updated data. The function returns a list of IDs of the added texts.

Additionally, there are functions for creating an index in the project, running similarity search with AtlasDB, and creating an AtlasDB vectorstore from a list of texts. Inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.
