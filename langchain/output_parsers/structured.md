This code defines a class `StructuredOutputParser` that parses structured output by checking that the output conforms to a JSON schema specified by a list of `ResponseSchema` objects. The `StructuredOutputParser` class includes a `parse` method that takes a string of structured output and returns a parsed output. The `parse` method first checks that the output is in the correct format by calling the `parse_json_markdown` function, which checks that the output is a markdown code snippet with a JSON object. If the output is in the correct format, the `parse` method checks that the JSON object conforms to the schema specified by the `response_schemas` attribute of the `StructuredOutputParser` object. The `StructuredOutputParser` class also includes a `get_format_instructions` method that returns format instructions for the parser and a `_type` property that returns a string identifier for the output parser type. The code also defines a `ResponseSchema` class that specifies the name, description, and type of each field in the JSON schema, and a `parse_json_markdown` function that checks that a string of structured output conforms to a list of expected keys and returns a parsed JSON object.
