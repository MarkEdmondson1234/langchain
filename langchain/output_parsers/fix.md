This code defines a class `OutputFixingParser` that wraps another output parser and tries to fix parsing errors by passing the original prompt and completion to another language model and telling it that the completion did not satisfy the criteria in the prompt. The `OutputFixingParser` class includes a `parse` method that takes a completion and returns a parsed output. If the original parser raises an `OutputParserException`, the `parse` method passes the error message to the retry chain along with the original completion and instructions for formatting the output. The retry chain runs the completion through another language model and returns a new completion, which is then passed to the original parser for parsing. The `OutputFixingParser` class also includes a `get_format_instructions` method that returns format instructions for the parser and a `_type` property that returns a string identifier for the output parser type. The code also defines a prompt template, `NAIVE_FIX_PROMPT`, that includes placeholders for instructions, completion, and error messages and can be used to prompt users to provide an answer that satisfies certain constraints by displaying the instructions, completion, and error messages in a formatted way.
