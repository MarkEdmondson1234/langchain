This code defines two classes, `RetryOutputParser` and `RetryWithErrorOutputParser`, that wrap other output parsers and try to fix parsing errors by passing the original prompt and completion to another language model and telling it that the completion did not satisfy the criteria in the prompt. The `RetryWithErrorOutputParser` class also provides the error that was raised back to the language model, which in theory should give it more information on how to fix it. Both classes include a `parse_with_prompt` method that takes a completion and a `PromptValue` object and returns a parsed output. They also include a `get_format_instructions` method that returns format instructions for the parser and a `_type` property that returns a string identifier for the output parser type. The code also defines two prompt templates, `NAIVE_COMPLETION_RETRY` and `NAIVE_COMPLETION_RETRY_WITH_ERROR`, that include placeholders for instructions, completion, and error messages. The `NAIVE_RETRY_PROMPT` and `NAIVE_RETRY_WITH_ERROR_PROMPT` instances of `PromptTemplate` are created using these templates and can be used to prompt users to provide an answer that satisfies certain constraints by displaying the instructions, completion, and error messages in a formatted way.
