This code defines several classes and imports for working with chat models and generating chat completions.

## functions
The code defines several classes and imports:
- `AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun` and `CallbackManagerForLLMRun` are classes for managing callbacks during chat completions.
- `BaseChatModel` is a base class for chat models.
- `_AnthropicCommon` is a class for working with Anthropic models.
- `AIMessage`, `BaseMessage`, `ChatGeneration`, `ChatMessage`, `ChatResult`, `HumanMessage`, and `SystemMessage` are classes for representing different types of chat messages.

## How the functions relate to each other
The classes and imports in this code are used for working with chat models and generating chat completions.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
There are no functions in this code, only classes and imports.

# heading
This code defines a class called `ChatAnthropic` that is a wrapper around Anthropic's large language model. The class has several methods for converting chat messages to text and generating chat completions using the Anthropic API. 

## functions
The code defines a single class called `ChatAnthropic`.

## How the functions relate to each other
The `ChatAnthropic` class is a wrapper around Anthropic's large language model. It has several methods for converting chat messages to text and generating chat completions using the Anthropic API.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `_convert_one_message_to_text`: Takes in a single `BaseMessage` object and returns a string representation of the message.
- `_convert_messages_to_text`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage` objects and returns a single string representation of the messages.
- `_convert_messages_to_prompt`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage` objects and returns a string representation of the messages that can be used as a prompt for the Anthropic API.
- `_generate`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage` objects, an optional list of stopping criteria, and an optional callback manager, and returns a `ChatResult` object containing the generated chat completions.

The `ChatResult` object contains a list of `ChatGeneration` objects, which in turn contain an `AIMessage` object representing the generated chat completion.

Inputs:
- `messages`: a list of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion.
- `stop`: an optional list of strings representing stopping criteria for the chat completion.
- `run_manager`: an optional callback manager for handling callbacks during the chat completion.

Outputs:
- `ChatResult`: a class representing the generated chat completions.

# heading
This code defines an async function called `_agenerate` that generates chat completions using the Anthropic API. The function takes in a list of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion, an optional list of stopping criteria, and an optional callback manager. It returns a `ChatResult` object containing the generated chat completions.

## functions
The code defines a single async function called `_agenerate`.

## How the functions relate to each other
The `_agenerate` function is used for generating chat completions using the Anthropic API.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `_agenerate`: Takes in a list of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion, an optional list of stopping criteria, and an optional callback manager, and returns a `ChatResult` object containing the generated chat completions.

The `ChatResult` object contains a list of `ChatGeneration` objects, which in turn contain an `AIMessage` object representing the generated chat completion.

Inputs:
- `messages`: a list of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion.
- `stop`: an optional list of strings representing stopping criteria for the chat completion.
- `run_manager`: an optional callback manager for handling callbacks during the chat completion.

Outputs:
- `ChatResult`: a class representing the generated chat completions.
