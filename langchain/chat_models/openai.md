The code you provided defines a wrapper class for OpenAI Chat models called `ChatOpenAI`. The purpose of the code is to provide an interface for interacting with OpenAI Chat models. 

The code includes several functions that relate to the OpenAI Chat API, such as `_create_retry_decorator` and `acompletion_with_retry`, which use the `tenacity` library to retry API calls in case of errors. The `_convert_dict_to_message` and `_convert_message_to_dict` functions are used to convert messages between dictionary and object formats.

The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

The `_convert_dict_to_message` and `_convert_message_to_dict` functions are used to convert messages between dictionary and object formats.

The `ChatOpenAI` class includes several properties and methods, such as `_default_params`, which returns the default parameters for calling the OpenAI API, and `_generate`, which generates chat completions using the OpenAI API. The `completion_with_retry` method uses the `tenacity` library to retry the completion call, while the `_combine_llm_outputs` method combines the outputs of multiple language models. The `_create_message_dicts` method creates message dictionaries from a list of messages and stop words.

The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

The code you provided defines several functions and methods for interacting with OpenAI Chat models through a wrapper class called `ChatOpenAI`. The `_create_chat_result` function creates a `ChatResult` object from a response dictionary returned by the OpenAI API. The `_agenerate` method generates chat completions asynchronously using the OpenAI API, while the `_identifying_params` property returns identifying parameters for the model. The `get_num_tokens` and `get_num_tokens_from_messages` methods calculate the number of tokens in a given text or list of messages using the `tiktoken` package. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.

# heading
Calculating the number of tokens used by a list of messages

## functions
The code defines a single function called `get_num_tokens_from_messages`.

## How the functions relate to each other
The `get_num_tokens_from_messages` function takes in a list of messages and calculates the number of tokens used by the messages using the `tiktoken` package. The function first determines the encoding for the model being used, and then calculates the number of tokens based on the model type and the content of the messages.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
## get_num_tokens_from_messages
Inputs:
- `messages`: a list of `BaseMessage` objects representing the messages to calculate the number of tokens for.

Outputs:
- `num_tokens`: an integer representing the total number of tokens used by the messages.
