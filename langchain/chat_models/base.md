# heading
This code defines several classes and imports for working with language models and generating chat completions.

## functions
The code defines several classes and imports:
- `BaseLanguageModel` is a base class for language models.
- `BaseCallbackManager` is a base class for callback managers.
- `CallbackManager` and `AsyncCallbackManager` are classes for managing callbacks during language model runs.
- `CallbackManagerForLLMRun` and `AsyncCallbackManagerForLLMRun` are classes for managing callbacks during chat completions.
- `Callbacks` is a class for storing and managing multiple callback managers.
- `AIMessage`, `BaseMessage`, `ChatGeneration`, `ChatResult`, `HumanMessage`, `LLMResult`, and `PromptValue` are classes for representing different types of language model messages.

## How the functions relate to each other
The classes and imports in this code are used for working with language models and generating chat completions.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
There are no functions in this code, only classes and imports.

# heading
This code defines a class called `BaseChatModel` that is a wrapper around language models and provides methods for generating chat completions. The class has several methods for generating chat completions using the language model, including `generate`, `agenerate`, and `generate_prompt`. 

## functions
The code defines a single class called `BaseChatModel`.

## How the functions relate to each other
The `BaseChatModel` class is a wrapper around language models and provides methods for generating chat completions using the language model.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `generate`: Takes in a list of lists of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion, an optional list of stopping criteria, and an optional callback manager, and returns an `LLMResult` object containing the generated chat completions.
- `agenerate`: Takes in a list of lists of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion, an optional list of stopping criteria, and an optional callback manager, and returns an `LLMResult` object containing the generated chat completions.
- `generate_prompt`: Takes in a list of `PromptValue` objects representing prompts for generating chat completions, an optional list of stopping criteria, and an optional callback manager, and returns an `LLMResult` object containing the generated chat completions.

The `LLMResult` object contains a list of `ChatGeneration` objects, which in turn contain an `AIMessage` object representing the generated chat completion.

Inputs:
- `messages`: a list of lists of `BaseMessage` objects representing the chat messages leading up to the desired completion.
- `stop`: an optional list of strings representing stopping criteria for the chat completion.
- `callbacks`: an optional callback manager for handling callbacks during the chat completion.

Outputs:
- `LLMResult`: a class representing the generated chat completions.

This code defines several methods for generating chat completions using a language model. The methods include `agenerate_prompt`, `_generate`, `_agenerate`, `__call__`, and `call_as_llm`. The `agenerate_prompt` method generates chat completions based on a list of prompts, while the `_generate` and `_agenerate` methods are abstract methods for generating chat completions. The `__call__` method is used to generate a chat completion based on a list of messages, while the `call_as_llm` method generates a chat completion based on a single message. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.

This code defines a class called `SimpleChatModel` that inherits from `BaseChatModel` and provides a simpler interface for generating chat completions using a language model. The class defines a single method called `_generate` that generates chat completions based on a list of messages using the `_call` method. The inputs and outputs for each method are described in the code.
