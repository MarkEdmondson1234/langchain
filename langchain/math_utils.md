# Code Summary
This code defines a function called cosine_similarity that calculates the row-wise cosine similarity between two equal-width matrices. It also defines a type alias called Matrix.

## Functions
- cosine_similarity: This function takes in two matrices and returns a matrix of cosine similarity scores where higher values indicate greater similarity.

# Inputs and Outputs
- cosine_similarity: This function takes in two matrices and returns a matrix of cosine similarity scores where higher values indicate greater similarity. The inputs are the two matrices and the output is the matrix of cosine similarity scores.
