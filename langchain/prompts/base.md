This code defines a schema for prompts, which includes a StringPromptTemplate class and various functions for checking the validity of templates and formatting them. The PromptTemplate class has methods for formatting prompts with inputs, loading prompts from files, and creating prompts from examples. The code also includes a backwards compatibility definition for Prompt. The code imports modules from pydantic, pathlib, and string.

The code defines a schema for prompts, including a StringPromptTemplate class and various functions for checking the validity of templates and formatting them. The PromptTemplate class has methods for formatting prompts with inputs, loading prompts from files, and creating prompts from examples. The code also includes a backwards compatibility definition for Prompt. The specific code you provided is a definition for the BasePromptTemplate class, which is a base class for all prompt templates that return a prompt. It includes methods for formatting prompts and creating partial templates, as well as functions for validating variable names and saving prompts to a file. The class also includes various input and output variables, including input variables that the prompt template expects and partial variables that can be used to create partial templates.

The code you provided is a function for saving prompts to a file. It creates a directory path and a dictionary of the prompt to save, and then checks the file type to determine how to save the prompt. If the file type is JSON, it uses the json.dump function to save the dictionary to the file. If the file type is YAML, it uses the yaml.dump function to save the dictionary to the file. If the file type is not JSON or YAML, it raises a ValueError.

# Code Summary
## Purpose
The code defines a schema for prompts, including a StringPromptTemplate class and various functions for checking the validity of templates and formatting them. The PromptTemplate class has methods for formatting prompts with inputs, loading prompts from files, and creating prompts from examples. The code also includes a backwards compatibility definition for Prompt.

## Functions
The specific code you provided is a definition for the `StringPromptTemplate` class, which is a subclass of the `BasePromptTemplate` class. It includes a method for formatting prompts with inputs and returning them as chat messages. The `format_prompt` method calls the `format` method of the `StringPromptTemplate` class and returns a `StringPromptValue` object with the formatted prompt as text.

## Inputs and Outputs
The `format_prompt` method takes any number of keyword arguments as inputs, which are used to format the prompt. The method returns a `PromptValue` object, specifically a `StringPromptValue` object, which has a `text` attribute containing the formatted prompt as a string.
