The code defines a class called `LengthBasedExampleSelector` for selecting examples based on their length. The class inherits from `BaseExampleSelector` and `BaseModel`. The code also defines methods for adding examples to a list, selecting examples based on their length, and calculating the length of examples. The `add_example` method takes a dictionary containing the example and adds it to the list. The `select_examples` method takes a dictionary of input variables and returns a list of examples whose total length is less than a maximum length specified by the `max_length` attribute. The `calculate_example_text_lengths` method calculates the length of each example in the list. The `get_text_length` attribute specifies the function used to measure the length of examples, which defaults to word count. The `examples` attribute is a list of examples that the prompt template expects. The `example_prompt` attribute is a prompt template used to format the examples. The `example_text_lengths` attribute is a list of the lengths of each example in the list.
