# Code Summary
## Purpose
The code defines a function called `sorted_values` that takes a dictionary of string keys and values and returns a list of the values sorted by key. The code also imports several modules related to language embeddings, example selection, and vector stores.

## Functions
The specific code you provided is a definition for the `sorted_values` function, which takes a dictionary of string keys and values as input and returns a list of the values sorted by key.

## Inputs and Outputs
The `sorted_values` function takes a dictionary of string keys and values as input and returns a list of the values sorted by key.

# Code Summary
## Purpose
The code defines a class called `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` for selecting examples based on their semantic similarity with a given input. The class inherits from `BaseExampleSelector` and `BaseModel`. The code also defines methods for adding examples to a vectorstore, selecting examples based on their semantic similarity with a given input, and creating a k-shot example selector using example list and embeddings.

## Functions
The code includes a definition for the `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` class, which has methods for adding examples to a vectorstore, selecting examples based on their semantic similarity with a given input, and creating a k-shot example selector using example list and embeddings. The `add_example` method takes a dictionary containing the example and adds it to the vectorstore. The `select_examples` method takes a dictionary of input variables and returns a list of examples sorted by their semantic similarity with the input. The `from_examples` method creates a k-shot example selector using example list and embeddings.

## Inputs and Outputs
The `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` class takes a vectorstore, a number of examples to select, and optional keys to filter examples and input to as inputs. The `add_example` method takes a dictionary containing the example and returns the ID of the added example. The `select_examples` method takes a dictionary of input variables and returns a list of examples sorted by their semantic similarity with the input. The `from_examples` method takes a list of examples, an embeddings API interface, a vector store DB interface class, and optional arguments for the vector store and returns an instance of the `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` class.

The code defines a class called `MaxMarginalRelevanceExampleSelector` for selecting examples based on their semantic similarity with a given input, using the Max Marginal Relevance algorithm. The class inherits from `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` and includes a method for selecting examples based on their semantic similarity with a given input, and a method for creating a k-shot example selector using example list and embeddings. The `select_examples` method takes a dictionary of input variables and returns a list of examples sorted by their semantic similarity with the input. The `from_examples` method takes a list of examples, an embeddings API interface, a vector store DB interface class, and optional arguments for the vector store and returns an instance of the `MaxMarginalRelevanceExampleSelector` class. The `fetch_k` attribute specifies the number of examples to fetch to rerank.
