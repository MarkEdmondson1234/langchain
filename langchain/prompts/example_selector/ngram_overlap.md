# Code Summary
## Purpose
The code defines a class called `NGramOverlapExampleSelector` for selecting and ordering examples based on their ngram overlap score with a given input. The class inherits from `BaseExampleSelector` and `BaseModel`. The code also defines a function called `ngram_overlap_score` for computing the ngram overlap score of a source and example as a sentence_bleu score.

## Functions
The code includes a definition for the `NGramOverlapExampleSelector` class, which has methods for adding examples to a list, selecting examples based on their ngram overlap score with a given input, and setting a threshold at which the algorithm stops. The `select_examples` method uses the `ngram_overlap_score` function to compute the ngram overlap score of each example with the input, sorts the examples by their score in descending order, and returns a list of examples that have a score greater than the threshold.

## Inputs and Outputs
The `NGramOverlapExampleSelector` class takes a list of examples, a prompt template used to format the examples, and a threshold value as inputs. The `add_example` method takes a dictionary containing the example and adds it to the list of examples. The `select_examples` method takes a dictionary of input variables and returns a list of examples sorted by their ngram overlap score with the input. The `ngram_overlap_score` function takes a source list and an example list as inputs and returns a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
