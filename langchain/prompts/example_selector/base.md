The code defines an interface called `BaseExampleSelector` for selecting examples to include in prompts. The interface includes two abstract methods: `add_example`, which adds a new example to the store for a key, and `select_examples`, which selects which examples to use based on the inputs. There are no inputs or outputs specified for either method.
