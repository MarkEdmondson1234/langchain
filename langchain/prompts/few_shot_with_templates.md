## Functions
There are no functions defined in this code.

# Inputs and Outputs
There are no inputs or outputs for this code.

This code defines a prompt template that contains few-shot examples. The `FewShotPromptWithTemplates` class contains several attributes, including `examples`, `example_selector`, `example_prompt`, `suffix`, `input_variables`, `example_separator`, `prefix`, `template_format`, and `validate_template`. There are two root validators defined, `check_examples_and_selector` and `template_is_valid`, which check that the `examples` and `example_selector` attributes are consistent and that the `prefix`, `suffix`, and `input_variables` attributes are consistent, respectively. There are also two methods defined, `_get_examples` and `format`, which are used to get the examples from either the `examples` attribute or the `example_selector` attribute and to format the prompt with the inputs, respectively.
