This code defines a set of tools for various tasks, such as file management, web scraping, and search engine queries. The code imports several modules and classes, including `BaseTool`, `StructuredTool`, `Tool`, `BingSearchResults`, `BingSearchRun`, `DuckDuckGoSearchResults`, `DuckDuckGoSearchRun`, `CopyFileTool`, `DeleteFileTool`, `FileSearchTool`, `ListDirectoryTool`, `MoveFileTool`, `ReadFileTool`, `WriteFileTool`, `GooglePlacesTool`, `GoogleSearchResults`, `GoogleSearchRun`, `GoogleSerperResults`, `GoogleSerperRun`, `HumanInputRun`, `IFTTTWebhook`, `APIOperation`, `OpenAPISpec`, `ClickTool`, `CurrentWebPageTool`, `ExtractHyperlinksTool`, `ExtractTextTool`, `GetElementsTool`, `NavigateBackTool`, `NavigateTool`, `AIPluginTool`, `SceneXplainTool`, `ShellTool`, `VectorStoreQATool`, `VectorStoreQAWithSourcesTool`, `WikipediaQueryRun`, `WolframAlphaQueryRun`, `ZapierNLAListActions`, `ZapierNLARunAction`, and `tool`. The code also defines a list called `__all__` that contains the names of all the tools.

The code defines several classes, including `SchemaAnnotationError`, `ToolMetaclass`, `_create_subset_model`, `_SchemaConfig`, and `create_schema_from_function`. These classes are used to define and manipulate Pydantic models for the tools. The `BaseTool` class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all tools. It has several subclasses that implement specific functionality. The `ToolMetaclass` class is a metaclass for `BaseTool` that ensures that the `args_schema` attribute is properly annotated. The `_create_subset_model` function creates a Pydantic model with a subset of fields from another model. The `_SchemaConfig` class is a configuration class for Pydantic models. The `create_schema_from_function` function

This code defines an interface for LangChain tools that must be implemented. It has several properties, including `name`, `description`, `args_schema`, `return_direct`, `verbose`, `callbacks`, and `callback_manager`. It also defines several methods, including `_parse_input`, `_run`, `_arun`, and `_to_args_and_kwargs`. The `args` property returns the schema of the tool's input arguments. The `raise_deprecation` method raises a warning if `callback_manager` is used. The `is_single_input` property returns whether the tool only accepts a single input.

This code defines methods for running LangChain tools. The `run` method runs the tool synchronously, while the `arun` method runs the tool asynchronously. Both methods take in a `tool_input` argument, which can be either a string or a dictionary, and several optional arguments, such as `verbose`, `start_color`, `color`, and `callbacks`. The `__call__` method makes the tool callable. The methods use several other methods and properties defined in the code, such as `_parse_input`, `_to_args_and_kwargs`, `_run`, `_arun`, `callbacks`, `CallbackManager`, and `AsyncCallbackManager`.

This code defines a class `Tool` that takes in a function or coroutine directly and provides methods for using the tool synchronously and asynchronously. The class has several properties, including `description`, `func`, and `coroutine`, and several methods, including `_to_args_and_kwargs`, `_run`, `_arun`, `__init__`, and `from_function`. The `args` property returns the schema of the tool's input arguments. The methods use several other methods and properties defined in the code, such as `args_schema`, `BaseTool`, `CallbackManagerForToolRun`, `AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun`, and `BaseModel`.

This code defines a class `StructuredTool` that can operate on any number of inputs. The class has several properties, including `description`, `args_schema`, `func`, and `coroutine`, and several methods, including `_run`, `_arun`, and `from_function`. The `args` property returns the schema of the tool's input arguments. The methods use several other methods and properties defined in the code, such as `BaseTool`, `CallbackManagerForToolRun`, `AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun`, `BaseModel`, and `create_schema_from_function`.

This code defines a Python decorator function called `tool` that can be used to turn a regular function into a tool that can be used with or without arguments. The `tool` function takes in several arguments, including `args`, `return_direct`, `args_schema`, and `infer_schema`. The resulting tool can be run using the `run()` function. The code also defines several helper functions, such as `_make_with_name` and `_make_tool`, that are used to create the tool. The code includes several examples of how to use the `tool` decorator to create different types of tools.
