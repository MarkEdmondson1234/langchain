This code defines two classes, `RequestsGetTool` and `RequestsPostTool`, that inherit from `BaseRequestsTool` and `BaseTool`. These classes provide methods for making GET and POST requests to an API endpoint, respectively. The `RequestsGetTool` class includes a method for running the tool synchronously and another for running it asynchronously, while the `RequestsPostTool` class includes similar methods but with different input requirements. The code also includes some helper functions for parsing input and cleaning URLs.

This code defines several classes for making requests to an API endpoint using various HTTP methods. Specifically, it defines the `RequestsPatchTool`, `RequestsPutTool`, and `RequestsDeleteTool` classes for making PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests, respectively. Each class inherits from `BaseRequestsTool` and `BaseTool` and includes methods for running the tool synchronously and asynchronously. The input for each tool is a JSON string with a URL and data to be sent in the request, and the output is the text response of the request. The code also includes some helper functions for parsing input and cleaning URLs.
