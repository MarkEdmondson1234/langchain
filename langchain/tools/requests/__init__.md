Tools for making requests to an API endpoint.

## functions
The code defines an OpenAPI model called `OpenAPISpec` that provides several methods for getting an OpenAPI spec from various sources, such as a dictionary, text, file path, or URL. It also includes methods for getting the base URL, valid HTTP methods for a specified path, and the operation object for a given path and HTTP method. Additionally, it includes a method for alerting if the OpenAPI spec is not supported and a method for parsing the OpenAPI spec object.

Several methods are also defined for getting components of an OpenAPI spec for a given operation, such as parameters and request body. These methods also handle errors if the specified component is not found in the spec. Additionally, it includes a method for getting a cleaned operation id from an operation id by replacing all punctuation with underscores.
