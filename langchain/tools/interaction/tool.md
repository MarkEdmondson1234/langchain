This code defines a set of tools for interacting with the user. The specific tools include a tool for asking for human input, a tool for using the Arxiv API to search for scientific articles, a tool for using the SceneXplain API to generate a detailed caption for an image, and a tool for using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather information for a specified location. Each tool is defined as a subclass of the BaseTool class and includes methods for running the tool synchronously and asynchronously. The code also includes several response messages for common errors and issues that may arise when working with the APIs. The specific code snippet you provided defines a deprecated tool called StdInInquireTool which is a tool for asking the user for input. The tool is defined as a subclass of the HumanInputRun class and includes methods for running the tool synchronously and asynchronously. The code also includes a warning message for the deprecated tool.
