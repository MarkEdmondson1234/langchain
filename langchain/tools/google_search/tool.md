This code defines two classes, `GoogleSearchRun` and `GoogleSearchResults`, that provide tools for making requests to the Google Search API and parsing the results. The `GoogleSearchRun` class is a tool that adds the capability to query the Google search API, while the `GoogleSearchResults` class is a tool that has the capability to query the Google Search API and get back JSON. Both classes inherit from `BaseTool` and include methods for running the tool synchronously and asynchronously. The input for each tool is a search query, and the output is either the text response of the query or a JSON array of the query results. The code also imports the `GoogleSearchAPIWrapper` from the `langchain.utilities.google_search` module.
