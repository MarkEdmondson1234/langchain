This code defines a `JiraAction` class for interacting with the atlassian-python-api library and operating on a Jira instance. The `JiraAction` class includes methods for running operations using the Jira API and requires setting environment variables for JIRA_API_TOKEN, JIRA_USERNAME, and JIRA_INSTANCE_URL. The code also includes a sample script for using the `JiraAction` class.
