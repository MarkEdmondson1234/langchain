The code defines tools for working with the Jira API through the atlassian-python-api library. Specifically, it defines the `JIRA_ISSUE_CREATE_PROMPT`, `JIRA_GET_ALL_PROJECTS_PROMPT`, `JIRA_JQL_PROMPT`, and `JIRA_CATCH_ALL_PROMPT` prompts for creating Jira issues, fetching projects, searching for issues, and performing other actions allowed by the Jira API. The inputs for each tool vary, but generally involve passing in a dictionary or string representing a JQL query or Python code calling a function from the Jira API. The outputs for each tool also vary, but generally involve returning information about Jira issues, projects, or other data.
