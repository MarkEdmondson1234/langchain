This code defines a tool for making queries to the Wolfram Alpha API and parsing the results. Specifically, it defines the `WolframAlphaQueryRun` class for making queries to the API. The input for the tool is a search query, and the output is a string of the result from the API. The code also imports the `WolframAlphaAPIWrapper` from the `langchain.utilities.wolfram_alpha` module.
