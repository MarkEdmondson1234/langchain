This code defines two Python classes, `SearxSearchRun` and `SearxSearchResults`, that provide tools for querying a Searx instance and retrieving search results. Both classes inherit from the `BaseTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with the Searx API. The `SearxSearchRun` class allows users to search for a query using the Searx API and retrieve the search results as a string. The `SearxSearchResults` class allows users to search for a query using the Searx API and retrieve the search results as a JSON array. Both classes use the `SearxSearchWrapper` class to wrap the Searx API and provide a simplified interface for using the API.
