This code defines a mixin for file system tools. The module includes a single class, `BaseFileToolMixin`, that provides a base class for creating tools that interact with files. The class includes a method, `get_relative_path`, that returns the relative path of a specified file, raising an error if the path is not within the specified root directory. The module also includes a function, `get_validated_relative_path`, that resolves a relative path, raising an error if the path is not within the specified root directory. The input and output for each function varies depending on the specific functionality provided.
