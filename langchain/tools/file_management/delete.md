This code defines a tool for deleting files. The module includes a single class, `DeleteFileTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseFileToolMixin` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with files and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively. The `DeleteFileTool` class takes a single input, `file_path`, which should be a string containing the path to the file to delete. The output is a string containing a message indicating whether the file was successfully deleted or if an error occurred. The `DeleteFileTool` class uses the `os` module to delete the specified file. The input for this method is typically a file path, and the output is typically a message indicating whether the file was successfully deleted or if an error occurred.
