This code defines a tool for searching for files in a subdirectory that match a specified regex pattern. The module includes a single class, `FileSearchTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseFileToolMixin` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with files and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively. The `FileSearchTool` class takes two inputs: `dir_path`, which should be a string containing the subdirectory to search in, and `pattern`, which should be a string containing the Unix shell regex pattern to match. The output is a string containing the relative paths of all files that match the specified pattern in the specified subdirectory. The `FileSearchTool` class uses the `os` and `fnmatch` modules to search for files that match the specified pattern. The input for this method is typically a subdirectory path and a regex pattern, and the output is typically a list of relative file paths that match the specified pattern.
