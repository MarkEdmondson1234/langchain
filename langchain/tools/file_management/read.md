This code defines a tool for reading files from disk. The module includes a single class, `ReadFileTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseFileToolMixin` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with files and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively. The `ReadFileTool` class takes a single input: `file_path`, which should be a string containing the name of the file to read. The output is a string containing the contents of the specified file. The `ReadFileTool` class uses the `open` method to read the specified file. The input for this method is typically a file path, and the output is typically the contents of the specified file.
