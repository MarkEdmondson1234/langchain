# File Management Tools

This code defines a set of tools for managing files. The module includes several classes, including `CopyFileTool`, `DeleteFileTool`, `FileSearchTool`, `ListDirectoryTool`, `MoveFileTool`, `ReadFileTool`, and `WriteFileTool`. Each class provides a specific functionality related to managing files, such as copying, deleting, searching, listing, moving, reading, and writing files. The classes inherit from the `BaseFileToolMixin` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with files and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively. The `__all__` variable is a list of all the classes defined in the module. The input and output for each class varies depending on the specific functionality provided.
