This code defines a tool for writing files to disk. The module includes a single class, `WriteFileTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseFileToolMixin` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with files and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively. The `WriteFileTool` class takes three inputs: `file_path`, which should be a string containing the name of the file to write to; `text`, which should be a string containing the text to write to the file; and `append`, which is a boolean indicating whether to append to an existing file. The output is a string indicating whether the file was successfully written or if an error occurred. The `WriteFileTool` class uses the `os` module to write the specified text to the specified file. The input for this method is typically a file path and text to write, and the output is typically a message indicating whether the file was successfully written or if an error occurred.
