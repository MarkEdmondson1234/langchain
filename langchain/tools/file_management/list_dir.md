This code defines a tool for listing files and directories in a specified folder. The module includes a single class, `ListDirectoryTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseFileToolMixin` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with files and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively. The `ListDirectoryTool` class takes a single input, `dir_path`, which should be a string containing the path to the directory to list. The output is a string containing a list of files and directories in the specified directory. The `ListDirectoryTool` class uses the `os` module to list the contents of the specified directory. The input for this method is typically a directory path, and the output is typically a list of files and directories in the specified directory.
