This code defines two Python classes called `PythonREPLTool` and `PythonAstREPLTool` that are used to create tools for running Python code in a REPL. The `PythonREPLTool` class has several properties, including `name`, `description`, and `python_repl`, and several methods, including `_run` and `_arun`. The `_run` method takes a Python command as input and returns the result of running the command in the REPL using the `python_repl` property. The `_arun` method raises a `NotImplementedError`. The `PythonAstREPLTool` class has similar properties and methods, but uses the `ast` module to parse and execute the Python code.
