This code defines a module for interacting with a SQL database. The module includes three classes: `QuerySQLDataBaseTool`, `InfoSQLDatabaseTool`, and `ListSQLDatabaseTool`. All three classes inherit from the `BaseSQLDatabaseTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with a SQL database. The `QuerySQLDataBaseTool` class allows users to execute SQL queries against a database and retrieve the results. The `InfoSQLDatabaseTool` class allows users to retrieve metadata about a database, such as the schema and sample rows for specific tables. The `ListSQLDatabaseTool` class allows users to retrieve a list of tables in the database. All three classes use the `SQLDatabase` class to connect to a database and execute queries. The input for these methods is typically a SQL query or a list of tables, and the output is typically a result set or a status message.

# heading
This code defines a tool for checking SQL queries for common mistakes.

## functions
The code defines a single class, `QueryCheckerTool`, that provides a tool for checking SQL queries for common mistakes. The class inherits from the `BaseSQLDatabaseTool` and `BaseTool` classes, which provide a base class for creating tools that interact with a SQL database and a base class for creating tools in general, respectively.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
The `QueryCheckerTool` class takes a single input, `query`, which should be a string containing the SQL query to check. The output is a string containing a checklist of common mistakes to look for when checking the query.

The `QueryCheckerTool` class uses an LLM (Language Model) to check the query for common mistakes. The LLM is initialized using a prompt template defined in the `QUERY_CHECKER` variable. The prompt template takes two inputs, `query` and `dialect`, and outputs a string containing a checklist of common mistakes to look for when checking the query.

The `QueryCheckerTool` class should be used to help ensure that SQL queries are free of common mistakes before they are executed against a database.
