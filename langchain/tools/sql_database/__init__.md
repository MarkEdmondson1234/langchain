# Inputs and outputs for each function
There are no specific functions defined in this code, but the module includes several classes that provide tools for interacting with a SQL database. The classes include properties and methods for connecting to a database, executing queries, and retrieving results. The input for these methods is typically a SQL query, and the output is typically a result set or a status message.

The module includes several classes, including `SQLAlchemyTool`, `SQLAlchemySessionTool`, `SQLAlchemyTableTool`, and `SQLAlchemyQueryTool`. These classes provide different levels of abstraction for interacting with a SQL database, from low-level query execution to high-level object mapping.
