# heading
This code defines a Python module that provides a tool for checking SQL queries for common mistakes.

## functions
There are no specific functions defined in this code, but the module includes a single variable, `QUERY_CHECKER`, that provides a template for checking SQL queries for common mistakes.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
There are no specific functions defined in this code, but the `QUERY_CHECKER` variable takes two inputs, `query` and `dialect`, and outputs a string that provides a checklist of common mistakes to look for when checking a SQL query. The `query` input should be a string containing the SQL query to check, and the `dialect` input should be a string indicating the SQL dialect used in the query (e.g. "MySQL", "PostgreSQL", etc.). The output is a string containing a checklist of common mistakes to look for when checking the query.

The `QUERY_CHECKER` variable can be used to help ensure that SQL queries are free of common mistakes before they are executed against a database.
