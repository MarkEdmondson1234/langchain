This code defines a tool for clicking on elements with a given CSS selector. The module includes a single class, `ClickTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseBrowserTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with web browsers. The `ClickTool` class takes a single input: `selector`, which should be a string containing the CSS selector for the element to click. The output is a string indicating whether the element was successfully clicked or if an error occurred. The `ClickTool` class uses the `page.click` method to click on the specified element. The input for this method is typically a CSS selector, and the output is typically a message indicating whether the element was successfully clicked or if an error occurred.
