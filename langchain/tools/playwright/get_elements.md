This code defines a tool for retrieving elements in the current web page matching the given CSS selector. The module includes a single class, `GetElementsTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseBrowserTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with web browsers. The `GetElementsTool` class takes two inputs: a CSS selector and a set of attributes to retrieve for each element. The output is a JSON string containing the results of the query. The `GetElementsTool` class uses the `page.query_selector_all` method to get a list of all the elements matching the given selector, and then loops through each element to extract the specified attributes. The input for this method is a CSS selector and a set of attributes to retrieve for each element, and the output is a JSON string containing the results of the query.
