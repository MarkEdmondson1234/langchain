# Summary
This code defines a tool for extracting hyperlinks from a webpage. The module includes a single class, `ExtractHyperlinksTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseBrowserTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with web browsers. 

## Functions
- `scrape_page`: Parses the HTML content of a webpage using BeautifulSoup and extracts all anchor elements and their href attributes. Returns a list of links as a JSON string.
- `_run`: Synchronously uses the tool to extract hyperlinks from the current webpage. Takes an optional boolean input `absolute_urls` that specifies whether to return absolute or relative URLs. Returns a string indicating the list of links as a JSON string.
- `_arun`: Asynchronously uses the tool to extract hyperlinks from the current webpage. Takes an optional boolean input `absolute_urls` that specifies whether to return absolute or relative URLs. Returns a string indicating the list of links as a JSON string.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- `scrape_page`: Takes three inputs: `page` (Any), `html_content` (str), and `absolute_urls` (bool). `page` represents the current webpage, `html_content` represents the HTML content of the current webpage, and `absolute_urls` specifies whether to return absolute or relative URLs. Returns a string indicating the list of links as a JSON string.
- `_run`: Takes two inputs: `absolute_urls` (bool) and `run_manager` (Optional[CallbackManagerForToolRun]). `absolute_urls` specifies whether to return absolute or relative URLs. `run_manager` is an optional input for managing callbacks during tool runs. Returns a string indicating the list of links as a JSON string.
- `_arun`: Takes two inputs: `absolute_urls` (bool) and `run_manager` (Optional[AsyncCallbackManagerForToolRun]). `absolute_urls` specifies whether to return absolute or relative URLs. `run_manager` is an optional input for managing callbacks during tool runs. Returns a string indicating the list of links as a JSON string.
