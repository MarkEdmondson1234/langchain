This code defines a tool for navigating back to the previous page in the browser history. The module includes a single class, `NavigateBackTool`, that provides this functionality. The class inherits from the `BaseBrowserTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with web browsers. The `NavigateBackTool` class takes no inputs. The output is a string indicating whether the navigation was successful or if an error occurred. The `NavigateBackTool` class uses the `page.go_back` method to navigate back to the previous page in the browser history. The input for this method is typically none, and the output is typically a message indicating whether the navigation was successful or if an error occurred.
