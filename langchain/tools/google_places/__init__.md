This code defines a Python module called `Google Places API Toolkit` that provides a tool for interacting with the Google Places API. The tool is defined in the `GooglePlacesTool` class, which inherits from the `BaseTool` class and includes several properties and methods for interacting with the API. The `GooglePlacesTool` class allows users to search for places using the Google Places API and retrieve information about those places, such as their name, address, and phone number. The module also includes an `__all__` variable that specifies which objects should be imported when the module is imported.
