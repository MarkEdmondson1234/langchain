This code defines Pydantic models for parsing an OpenAPI spec. The module includes several classes and functions for defining and validating API properties, such as `APIPropertyBase` and `APIPropertyLocation`. The module also includes a set of primitive types, such as `int`, `float`, and `str`, that are used to define the types of API properties. The input for these classes and functions is a set of parameters that define the API properties, and the output is a validated set of API properties that can be used to generate an OpenAPI spec.

The module also includes a set of primitive types, such as `int`, `float`, and `str`, that are used to define the types of API properties. The `from_parameter` method is a class method that instantiates an `APIProperty` object from an OpenAPI parameter. The method takes two inputs: a `Parameter` object and an `OpenAPISpec` object. The output is an `APIProperty` object that represents the parameter. The `from_parameter` method uses several other methods, such as `_validate_location` and `_get_schema_type`, to validate and parse the parameter.

The output is an `APIProperty` object that represents the parameter. The `APIRequestBodyProperty` class is a model for a request body property. It includes methods for processing object and array schemas and recursively populating them from an OpenAPI schema. The `from_schema` method takes a schema, name, required flag, and OpenAPISpec object as inputs and returns an `APIRequestBodyProperty` object.

This code defines a Pydantic model for parsing an OpenAPI spec. The `APIOperation` class is a model for a single API operation. It includes methods for creating an `APIOperation` object from an OpenAPI URL or spec. The `from_openapi_url` method takes a spec URL, path, and method as inputs and returns an `APIOperation` object that represents the operation. The `from_openapi_spec` method takes an `OpenAPISpec` object, path, and method as inputs and returns an `APIOperation` object that represents the operation. The `APIOperation` class also includes a method for getting the properties of the operation from its parameters. The `_get_properties_from_parameters` method takes a list of `Parameter` objects and an `OpenAPISpec` object as inputs and returns a list of `APIProperty` objects that represent the operation's properties. The `APIOperation` class includes several fields that represent the operation's properties, such as `operation_id`, `description`, `base_url`, `path`, `method`, and `properties`. It also includes a field for the operation's request body, which is an `APIRequestBody` object.

This code defines several methods for generating TypeScript definitions from an OpenAPI spec. The `ts_type_from_python` method converts Python types to TypeScript types. The `_format_nested_properties` method formats nested properties for the TypeScript definition. The `to_typescript` method generates the TypeScript definition for an `APIOperation` object. The `query_params`, `path_params`, and `body_params` methods return lists of parameter names for each location in the operation.
