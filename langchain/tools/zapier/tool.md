This code provides an overview of the Zapier Natural Language Actions API, which allows users to access over 5,000 apps and 20,000 actions on Zapier's platform through a natural language API interface. The code includes information about how Zapier NLA handles API authentication and translation, as well as how to use the API for both server-side and user-facing scenarios. The code also includes a basic example of how to use the API with the SequentialChain tool. Additionally, the code defines a Python class called `BaseTool` that serves as a base class for creating tools that interact with the Zapier API. The class includes several properties and methods, including `name`, `description`, `args_schema`, and `_run`. The `ZapierNLAWrapper` class is used to wrap the Zapier NLA API and provide a simplified interface for using the API. The `BASE_ZAPIER_TOOL_PROMPT` string provides a prompt for using the Zapier NLA tool.

This code defines two Python classes, `ZapierNLARunAction` and `ZapierNLAListActions`, that interact with the Zapier Natural Language Actions API. `ZapierNLARunAction` allows users to execute a specific action by providing an action ID, natural language instructions, and optional parameters. `ZapierNLAListActions` returns a list of all exposed user actions. Both classes inherit from the `BaseTool` class, which provides a base class for creating tools that interact with the Zapier API. The code also includes several properties and methods, including `name`, `description`, `args_schema`, and `_run`. The `ZapierNLAWrapper` class is used to wrap the Zapier NLA API and provide a simplified interface for using the API.
