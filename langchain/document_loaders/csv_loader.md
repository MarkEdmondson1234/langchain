The code defines a class called CSVLoader, which is used to load CSV files into a list of Document objects. Each Document object represents one row of the CSV file, with key/value pairs outputted to a new line in the page_content field. The source for each Document is set to the value of the file_path argument by default, but can be overridden by setting the source_column argument to the name of a column in the CSV file. The load method returns a list of Document objects with page_content and metadata fields. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load CSV files and convert them into Document objects.
