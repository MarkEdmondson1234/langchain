The code defines a class called PlaywrightURLLoader that is used to load web pages using Playwright and unstructured. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load web pages that require javascript to render and convert them into Document objects. The class has one method, load, which takes no inputs and returns a list of Document objects. The load method uses Playwright to load the specified URLs and unstructured to parse the HTML content of the pages. The resulting Document objects contain the parsed HTML content and metadata indicating the source URL. The class has several attributes, including the URLs to load, a flag indicating whether to continue loading other URLs on failure, a flag indicating whether to run the browser in headless mode, and an optional list of CSS selectors to remove from the loaded HTML content.
