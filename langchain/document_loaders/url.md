The load method reads in the contents of the HTML file and stores it in the page_content field of a Document object, along with metadata indicating the source file. The code you provided is a method within the UnstructuredURLLoader class that is used to process the loaded HTML content into Document objects. The method has two modes, "single" and "elements", which determine how the HTML content is processed.
