This code defines a class called `SpreedlyLoader` which is used to fetch data from the Spreedly API. The `SpreedlyLoader` class inherits from the `BaseLoader` class and has an `__init__` method that takes in two arguments: `access_token` and `resource`. The `load` method of the `SpreedlyLoader` class fetches the data from the specified Spreedly API resource and returns a list containing a `Document` object with the JSON content and metadata. The script also imports the `json`, `urllib.request`, `List`, `Document`, and `BaseLoader` modules, and uses the `stringify_dict` function from the `langchain.utils` module to convert the JSON data to a string.
