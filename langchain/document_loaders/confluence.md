This code appears to be a Python script that loads data from a Confluence Space. The script imports several modules, including logging and typing. It also imports functions from the tenacity module, which is used for retrying failed operations. The script defines a Document class from the langchain.docstore.document module and a BaseLoader class from the langchain.document_loaders.base module. The logger module is used for logging messages. As for the functions, there doesn't appear to be any defined in this code snippet. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!

This code defines a Python class called ConfluenceLoader, which is a port of a Confluence page loader from LlamaHub. The class supports both username/api_key and OAuth2 login and can load pages into Document objects. It also allows for the inclusion of attachments, which can be downloaded and added to the Document object. The class has several parameters, including url, api_key, username, oauth2, cloud, number_of_retries, min_retry_seconds, max_retry_seconds, and confluence_kwargs. The class also has a static method called validate_init_args, which validates the input arguments. The code imports several modules, including logging and typing, and uses the atlassian module for accessing Confluence.

The function paginate_request is used to paginate the various methods to retrieve groups of pages. The function load loads pages based on space_key, page_ids, label, and cql. It also includes several optional parameters for filtering and limiting the results. The function returns a list of Document objects.

The functions process_pdf, process_image, process_doc, process_xls, and process_svg are used to process different types of attachments into text. They take a link to the attachment and return a string of text.
