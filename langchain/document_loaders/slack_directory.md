Sure, I can help with that! This code is a loader for documents from a Slack export. It imports the necessary modules and defines a class called BaseLoader. This class has a function called load_documents that takes in a path to a Slack export zip file and returns a list of Document objects. The load_documents function first extracts the zip file and then reads the JSON files containing the Slack messages. It then creates a Document object for each message and adds it to the list. The inputs for the load_documents function are the path to the zip file, and the output is a list of Document objects. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Sure, I can help with that! This code defines a class called SlackDirectoryLoader that loads documents from a Slack directory dump. The class has several functions that work together to extract JSON files containing Slack messages from a zip file, convert each message into a Document object, and return a list of Document objects. The inputs for the SlackDirectoryLoader class are the path to the zip file and an optional Slack workspace URL, and the output is a list of Document objects. The functions within the class are related in that they all contribute to the process of loading and converting Slack messages into Document objects. Let me know if you have any other questions!
