This code defines a Python class called NotionDBLoader, which is used to load data from a Notion database into a list of Document objects. The class has several parameters, including integration_token and database_id. The load function retrieves data from the Notion API using the requests package and returns a list of Document objects. The class also has several helper functions for formatting and processing the data.

This code defines a helper function called _load_blocks and a helper function called _request within the NotionDBLoader class. The _load_blocks function is used to read a block and its children from a Notion database and return the content as a string.
