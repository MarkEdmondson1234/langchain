This code defines a class called WebBaseLoader that is used to load webpages using urllib and BeautifulSoup. The class has an __init__() method that initializes the class with a webpage path, a header template, and a timeout. The class also has several methods including _fetch(), _fetch_with_rate_limit(), fetch_all(), _check_parser(), and scrape_all(). The _fetch() method fetches a webpage from a given URL, _fetch_with_rate_limit() fetches a webpage with rate limiting, fetch_all() fetches all URLs concurrently with rate limiting, _check_parser() checks if a parser is valid for BeautifulSoup, and scrape_all() fetches all URLs and returns soups for all results. The example code shows how to use the WebBaseLoader class by creating an object with a webpage path, loading data from the webpage, and printing the number of documents loaded.
