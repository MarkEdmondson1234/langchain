This code defines a class called JSONLoader that loads data from a JSON file. The class has an __init__() method that initializes the class with a file path, a jq schema to use to extract the data or text from the JSON, a content key to use to extract the content from the JSON if the jq schema results in a list of objects (dict), and a metadata function that takes in the JSON object extracted by the jq schema and the default metadata and returns a dict of the updated metadata. The class also has a load() method that loads documents from the JSON file and returns them as a list of Document objects. The example code shows how to use the JSONLoader class by creating an object with the file path and the jq schema, loading documents from the file, and printing the number of documents loaded.
