This code defines a class called DirectoryLoader that loads documents from a directory. The class has an __init__() method that initializes the class with the path to the directory, glob pattern, silent_errors flag, load_hidden flag, loader_cls, loader_kwargs, recursive flag, and show_progress flag. The class also has a load() method that loads documents from the directory and returns Document instances. The _is_visible() function checks whether a file is visible or not. The example code shows how to use the DirectoryLoader class by creating an object with the directory path, loading documents from the directory, and returning Document instances.
