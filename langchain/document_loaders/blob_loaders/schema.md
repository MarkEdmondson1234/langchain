This code defines a schema for blobs and blob loaders. The goal is to facilitate decoupling of content loading from content parsing code and provide a lazy loading interface by default. The code imports the `contextlib`, `mimetypes`, `ABC`, `abstractmethod`, `BufferedReader`, `BytesIO`, `PurePath`, `Any`, `Generator`, `Iterable`, `Mapping`, `Optional`, `Union`, `BaseModel`, and `root_validator` modules, and defines a `PathLike` type alias. The code defines an abstract `BlobLoader` class with a `yield_blobs` method, a `Blob` class with `key` and `content` attributes, and a `BaseBlob` class that inherits from `BaseModel` and defines the schema for a blob. The `Blob` class inherits from `BaseBlob` and defines a `from_path` method that reads the content of a file and returns a `Blob` object. The `BaseBlobLoader` class inherits from `ABC` and defines the schema for a blob loader. The `BaseBlobLoader` class also defines a `load` method that returns a generator of `Blob` objects. The `WebBaseLoader` class and `FileSystemBlobLoader` class inherit from `BaseBlobLoader` and define the interface for loading blobs from the web and local file system, respectively.

This code defines a class called `Blob` that represents raw data by either reference or value. The `Blob` class provides an interface to materialize the blob in different representations and helps to decouple the development of data loaders from the downstream parsing of the raw data. The `Blob` class has several methods for reading data as a string, bytes, or byte stream, and for loading the blob from a path-like object. The `Blob` class also defines a `Config` class and a `root_validator` method for verifying that either data or path is provided.

This code defines a class method called `from_data` that initializes a `Blob` object from in-memory data. The `from_data` method takes in four arguments: `data`, `encoding`, `mime_type`, and `path`, and returns a `Blob` instance. The `__repr__` method of the `Blob` class defines the representation of a `Blob` object as a string.

This code defines an abstract class called `BlobLoader` that provides an interface for loading raw content from a storage system according to some criteria and returning the raw content lazily as a stream of blobs. The `BlobLoader` class has an abstract `yield_blobs` method that returns a generator over `Blob` objects.
