The code defines a class called `CoNLLULoader` for loading CoNLL-U files. The class includes a `load` method that reads the file at a given file path and returns a `Document` object with the file's contents. The code imports the `csv` module and the `Document` and `BaseLoader` classes from other modules. 

The functions in the code are:
- `__init__`: initializes the `CoNLLULoader` object with a file path.
- `load`: loads the contents of the file at the given file path into a `Document` object.

The `load` function is the only function in the class and is used to load the contents of a CoNLL-U file into a `Document` object. The `__init__` function is used to initialize the `CoNLLULoader` object with a file path.

The inputs and outputs for the `load` function are:
- Inputs: `file_path` (str)
- Outputs: List of `Document` objects
