The code defines two classes, UnstructuredPDFLoader and BasePDFLoader, that are used to load PDF files. UnstructuredPDFLoader is a subclass of UnstructuredFileLoader and is used to load PDF files using the unstructured module. BasePDFLoader is a base class for loading PDF files and includes two subclasses, OnlinePDFLoader and PyPDFLoader. OnlinePDFLoader is used to load online PDFs, while PyPDFLoader loads a PDF with pypdf and chunks at character level. Both subclasses of BasePDFLoader return a list of Document objects with page_content and metadata fields. The code also includes various imports and helper functions.

The code defines several classes for loading PDF files, including UnstructuredPDFLoader, which uses the unstructured module to load PDF files; OnlinePDFLoader, which loads online PDFs; PyPDFLoader, which loads a PDF with pypdf and chunks at character level; PyPDFium2Loader, which loads a PDF with pypdfium2 and chunks at character level; PDFMinerLoader, which uses PDFMiner to load PDF files; and PyPDFDirectoryLoader, which loads a directory with PDF files with pypdf and chunks at character level. The code also includes various imports and helper functions. The functions are related by their purpose of loading PDF files, and each function takes a file path as input and returns a list of Document objects with page_content and metadata fields.

The code defines two classes, UnstructuredPDFLoader and BasePDFLoader, that are used to load PDF files. UnstructuredPDFLoader is a subclass of UnstructuredFileLoader and is used to load PDF files using the unstructured module. BasePDFLoader is a base class for loading PDF files and includes several subclasses, including PyPDFLoader, PyPDFium2Loader, PDFMinerLoader, PDFMinerPDFasHTMLLoader, PyMuPDFLoader, and PyPDFDirectoryLoader. Each subclass of BasePDFLoader takes a file path as input and returns a list of Document objects with page_content and metadata fields. The functions are related by their purpose of loading PDF files. The PyMuPDFLoader class uses the PyMuPDF library to load PDF files, while the PDFMinerPDFasHTMLLoader class uses PDFMiner to load PDF files as HTML content.

The code defines a class called MathpixPDFLoader that is used to load PDF files. It is a subclass of BasePDFLoader and includes several methods for sending PDFs to the Mathpix API for processing, waiting for the processing to complete, and retrieving the processed PDF. It also includes a method for cleaning the PDF contents and returning them as a string. The load method returns a list of Document objects with page_content and metadata fields. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load PDF files and process them with the Mathpix API.
