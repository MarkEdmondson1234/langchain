This code defines a class called ObsidianLoader that loads Obsidian files from disk. The class has an __init__() method that initializes the class with the file path, encoding, and a collect_metadata flag. The class also has a load() method that loads documents from the file path and returns Document instances. The _parse_front_matter() method parses front matter metadata from the content and returns it as a dictionary. The _remove_front_matter() method removes front matter metadata from the given content. The example code shows how to use the ObsidianLoader class by creating an object with the file path, loading documents from the file path, and returning Document instances.
