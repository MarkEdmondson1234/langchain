The code defines a class called OneDriveLoader that is used to load data from OneDrive using the O365 library. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load data from OneDrive and convert it into Document objects. The class has several methods and attributes, including _OneDriveSettings, _OneDriveTokenStorage, _FileType, and _SupportedFileTypes. The _OneDriveSettings class defines the client ID and client secret for the OneDrive API. The _OneDriveTokenStorage class defines the token path for storing the OneDrive access token. The _FileType class defines the supported file types for loading from OneDrive. The _SupportedFileTypes class defines a method to fetch the MIME types for the supported file types. The OneDriveLoader class has several methods, including load, _get_drive, and _get_folder. The load method takes no inputs and returns a list of Document objects. The load method uses the OneDriveFileLoader class to retrieve the specified files from OneDrive and create Document objects from the resulting data. The resulting Document objects contain the file content and metadata indicating the source OneDrive file and file creation time. The class has several attributes, including the authentication handler to use when connecting to OneDrive, the OneDrive file types to retrieve, and the number of files to retrieve.

The resulting Document objects contain the file content and metadata indicating the source OneDrive file and file creation time. The class has several attributes, including the authentication handler to use when connecting to OneDrive, the OneDrive file types to retrieve, and the number of files to retrieve. The load method calls two other methods, _load_from_folder and _load_from_object_ids, to retrieve the specified files from OneDrive. The _load_from_folder method takes a folder object as input and returns a list of Document objects. The _load_from_object_ids method takes a drive object as input and returns a list of Document objects. Both methods use the OneDriveFileLoader class to retrieve the specified files from OneDrive and create Document objects from the resulting data.
