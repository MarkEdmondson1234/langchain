This code defines a class called NotebookLoader that loads .ipynb notebook files. The class has an __init__() method that initializes the class with a path, whether to include outputs, the maximum output length, whether to remove newlines, and whether to include traceback. The class also has a load() method that loads documents from the notebook file and returns them as a list of Document objects. The concatenate_cells() function combines cells information in a readable format ready to be used, while the remove_newlines() function removes recursively newlines, no matter the data structure they are stored in. The example code shows how to use the NotebookLoader class by creating an object with the path to the notebook file, loading documents from the file, and printing the number of documents loaded.
