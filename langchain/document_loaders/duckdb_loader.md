The code defines a class called DuckDBLoader that is used to load a query result from DuckDB into a list of Document objects. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load query results and convert them into Document objects. The class has one method, load, which takes no inputs and returns a list of Document objects. The load method uses DuckDB to execute the specified query and create Document objects from the resulting data. The resulting Document objects contain the page content and metadata indicating the source query result. The class has several attributes, including the query to execute, the database to connect to, and various optional arguments to pass to DuckDB.
