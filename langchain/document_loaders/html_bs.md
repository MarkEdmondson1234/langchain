This code defines a class called `BSHTMLLoader` which is used to load HTML files and enrich their metadata with the page title. The `BSHTMLLoader` class inherits from the `BaseLoader` class and has an `__init__` method that takes in four arguments: `file_path`, `open_encoding`, `bs_kwargs`, and `get_text_separator`. The `load` method of the `BSHTMLLoader` class loads the HTML file into a `BeautifulSoup` object, extracts the text using the `get_text` method, and returns a list containing a `Document` object with the HTML content and metadata. The script also imports the `logging`, `Dict`, `List`, `Union`, `Document`, and `BaseLoader` modules, and uses the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` module to parse the HTML.
