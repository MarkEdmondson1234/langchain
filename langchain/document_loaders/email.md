The code defines two classes, UnstructuredEmailLoader and OutlookMessageLoader, that are used to load email files and Outlook Message files, respectively. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load email files and Outlook Message files and convert them into Document objects. The UnstructuredEmailLoader class has one method, _get_elements, which takes no inputs and returns a list of elements parsed from the specified email file. The _get_elements method uses the partition_email or partition_msg function from the unstructured library to parse the email file and create a list of elements. The resulting elements can be used to create Document objects with the page content and metadata indicating the source email file. The class has several attributes, including the file path to load and various optional arguments to pass to the partition_email or partition_msg function. The OutlookMessageLoader class has one method, load, which takes no inputs and returns a list of Document objects. The load method uses the extract_msg library to extract the body and metadata from the specified Outlook Message file and create a Document object. The resulting Document object contains the email content and metadata indicating the email subject, sender, and date. The class has one attribute, the file path to load.
