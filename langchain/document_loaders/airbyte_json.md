The code defines a class called AirbyteJSONLoader that is used to load local airbyte json files into a list of Document objects. The load method returns a list of Document objects with page_content and metadata fields. The purpose of the script is to provide a way to load local airbyte json files and convert them into Document objects. The class has one method, load, which takes no inputs and returns a list of Document objects. The load method reads in the contents of the json file and converts it into a string using the stringify_dict function. The resulting string is then stored in the page_content field of a Document object, along with metadata indicating the source file.
