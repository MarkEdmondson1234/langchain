This code defines a class called DiffbotLoader that loads webpages in text format using the Diffbot REST API. The class has an __init__() method that initializes the class with the API token, URLs, and a continue_on_failure flag. The class also has a load() method that extracts text from Diffbot on all the URLs and returns Document instances. The _diffbot_api_url() method returns the Diffbot API URL for a given Diffbot API. The _get_diffbot_data() method gets Diffbot file from the Diffbot REST API for a given URL. The method returns the Diffbot file as a JSON object. The method also handles non-ok errors and returns an empty dictionary if the response is not ok. The example code shows how to use the DiffbotLoader class by creating an object with the API token and URLs, loading webpages in text format using the Diffbot REST API, and returning Document instances.
