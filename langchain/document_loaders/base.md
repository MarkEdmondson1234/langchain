This code defines two abstract classes, `BaseLoader` and `BaseBlobParser`, which provide interfaces for loading and parsing documents respectively. The `BaseLoader` class has an abstract `load` method for loading data into document objects, a `load_and_split` method for loading documents and splitting them into chunks, and a `lazy_load` method for lazy-loading document content. The `BaseBlobParser` class has an abstract `lazy_parse` method for lazily parsing raw data stored in a blob into one or more documents, and a `parse` method for eagerly parsing the blob into a document or documents. Both classes use the `Document` class from the `langchain.schema` module.
