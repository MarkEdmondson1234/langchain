# A Title
Interact with LangChain+ API and perform natural language processing tasks.

## Keywords
LangChain+, API, NLP, machine learning.

## Classes
- LangChainPlusClient: Defines a client for interacting with the LangChain+ API. Includes several methods for making API requests such as _get and upload_dataframe.

## Functions/Methods
- run_llm: Run the language model on the example.
- run_llm_or_chain: Run the chain synchronously.
- run_on_dataset: Run the chain on a dataset and store traces to the specified session name.

## Code Examples of Use
```python
for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    result = self.run_llm_or_chain(
        example,
        tracer,
        llm_or_chain,
        num_repetitions,
    )
    if verbose:
        print(f"{i+1} processed", flush=True, end="\r")
    results[str(example.id)] = result
return results
```
