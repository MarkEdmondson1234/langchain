# Summary
The code provides a cache interface for storing and looking up generated text. It defines two classes, InMemoryCache and SQLAlchemyCache, that implement the BaseCache interface. InMemoryCache stores the cache in memory, while SQLAlchemyCache uses SQLAlchemy to store the cache in an SQLite database. 

## Functions
- BaseCache: abstract base class that defines the cache interface. It has three abstract methods: lookup, update, and clear.
- InMemoryCache: implementation of the cache interface that stores the cache in memory. It has three methods: lookup, update, and clear.
- FullLLMCache: SQLAlchemy model that defines the schema for the cache table.
- SQLAlchemyCache: implementation of the cache interface that uses SQLAlchemy to store the cache in an SQLite database. It has three methods: lookup, update, and clear.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- BaseCache:
  - Inputs:
    - prompt: a string representing the prompt for which to look up or update the cache
    - llm_string: a string representing the language model used to generate the text
    - return_val: a list of Generation objects representing the generated text
  - Outputs:
    - lookup: an optional list of Generation objects representing the cached text, or None if not found
    - update: None
    - clear: None
- InMemoryCache:
  - Inputs:
    - prompt: a string representing the prompt for which to look up or update the cache
    - llm_string: a string representing the language model used to generate the text
    - return_val: a list of Generation objects representing the generated text
  - Outputs:
    - lookup: an optional list of

# Summary
The code provides two cache implementations, SQLiteCache and RedisCache, that store and look up generated text. SQLiteCache uses SQLite as a backend, while RedisCache uses Redis as a backend. 

## Functions
- SQLiteCache: implementation of the cache interface that uses SQLite to store the cache in a database. It has one method: __init__.
- RedisCache: implementation of the cache interface that uses Redis to store the cache in memory. It has three methods: _key, lookup, update, and clear.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- SQLiteCache:
  - Inputs:
    - database_path: a string representing the path to the SQLite database file
  - Outputs:
    - None
- RedisCache:
  - Inputs:
    - redis_: a Redis object to use for caching
    - prompt: a string representing the prompt for which to look up or update the cache
    - llm_string: a string representing the language model used to generate the text
    - return_val: a list of Generation objects representing the generated text
  - Outputs:
    - lookup: an optional list of Generation objects representing the cached text, or None if not found
    - update: None
    - clear: None

# Summary
The code provides a cache implementation, RedisSemanticCache, that uses Redis as a vector-store backend for storing and looking up generated text. It defines three methods: _index_name, _get_llm_cache, and clear for managing the cache, and lookup and update for looking up and updating the cache.

# Inputs and outputs for each function
- RedisSemanticCache:
  - Inputs:
    - redis_url: a string representing the URL to connect to Redis
    - embedding: an Embeddings object representing the embedding provider for semantic encoding and search
    - score_threshold: a float representing the score threshold for similarity search
  - Outputs:
    - lookup: an optional list of Generation objects representing the cached text, or None if not found
    - update: None
    - clear: None

The code provides a cache implementation, GPTCache, that uses GPTCache as a backend for storing and looking up generated text. It defines three methods: _get_gptcache, clear, lookup, and update for managing the cache. The _get_gptcache method retrieves a cache object, the clear method clears the cache, the lookup method retrieves data from the cache based on the prompt, and the update method stores the prompt and return_val in the cache object. The inputs and outputs for each function are described in the code.
